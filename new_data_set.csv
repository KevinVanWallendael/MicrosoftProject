Select committee chair Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) began the hearing with a sweeping statement: Trump attempted to thwart the peaceful transfer of power and spurred “a mob of domestic enemies of the Constitution” to attack the Capitol. And in a nod to doubters, he augmented his statement with an excerpt of video testimony from former Attorney General Bill Barr, who said he told Trump his claims of election fraud were “bullshit.”

“You can’t live in a world where the incumbent administration stays in power based on its view, unsupported by specific evidence, that there was fraud in the election,” Barr said, adding that it contributed to his decision to leave the Trump administration in Dec. 2020.

In her own opening statement, committee vice chair Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) confirmed reports that while members of the Jan. 6 mob chanted “Hang Mike Pence,” Trump said to aides, “Maybe our supporters have the right idea. Mike Pence deserves it.’”

Relying on video testimony from Barr, as well as Trump campaign advisers Jason Miller and Alex Cannon, Cheney laid out a case that Trump was repeatedly informed by his allies that his claims of fraud were wrong and insufficient to reverse the outcome of the election. But Trump persisted in making the public claims anyway, she noted. Cheney similarly played a brief video clip of Ivanka Trump’s testimony, in which she said she believed Barr when he said there was insufficient evidence of fraud to influence the outcome of the election.

Miller noted on Twitter that Trump responded to his advisers’ doubts by suggesting they were underestimating the prospect of winning some of their pending legal challenges.

Cheney also pushed back on some GOP lines of attack about Jan. 6, saying though the panel would present information on how the Capitol should have been better prepared, the U.S. Capitol Police should not be blamed.

“We will not blame the violence that day, violence provoked by President Trump, on the officers who bravely defended all of us,” she said.

The video about Trump’s tweet, narrated by a select committee investigator, showed how social media chatter about stopping the transition of power picked up following the then-president’s “wild” promise — and how extremists in the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers viewed it as a call to action.

One of the panel’s two live witnesses Thursday night, documentarian Nick Quested, was embedded with the Proud Boys before Jan. 6 and witnessed their discussions about the plan to descend on Washington. He told the select committee he watched the Proud Boys gather at the Washington monument and march to the Capitol, where they approached access points to the Capitol that were thinly guarded by police.

The other live witness, Capitol Police officer Caroline Edwards, was wounded in the first moment of violence after a rioter who’d just huddled with a Florida Proud Boy charged through a law enforcement perimeter.

Edwards described the confrontation with rioters, when she was briefly knocked unconscious but later returned to duty.

“What I saw was just a war scene,” she said. “There were officers on the ground. They were bleeding. They were throwing up. I saw friends with blood all over their faces. I was slipping in people’s blood. I was catching people as they fell. It was carnage. It was chaos.”

The panel focused on the Proud Boys’ behavior to foment the attack on the Capitol. Several of their leaders have been charged with seditious conspiracy, a crime that requires an intent to violently oppose the government.

The Justice Department has described Proud Boys as playing a leadership role within the mob that day, leading Trump supporters to the foot of the Capitol and ultimately inside. In court documents, prosecutors described Proud Boys discussions about using regular members of the mob — “normies,” as the group described them — to ratchet up the violence.

Enrique Tarrio, the group’s national chair, testified to the select committee in February. His attorney said in court papers Wednesday that Tarrio answered some of the committee’s substantive questions.

The committee also featured video testimony from some of the people who joined the mob that disrupted the certification of 2020 Electoral College votes, stoked by Trump’s false claims that the election was stolen.

That testimony lays the foundation for the committee’s series of hearings planned this month. The attack on the Capitol sent Congress and then-Vice President Mike Pence fleeing for safety and injured more than 140 police officers.

The select panel views Trump as singularly responsible for motivating the violence by propagating baseless election fraud allegations and embracing fringe theories about Pence’s ability to single-handedly overturn the election on Jan. 6, when he presided over a joint session of Congress to count electoral votes.

Some attributed their actions to Trump himself. In court filings, several have described their closed-door depositions to the select committee, saying they told the panel that they bought into Trump’s falsehoods about the election.

One of them, Greg Rubenacker, was among the first wave of rioters who entered the Capitol and joined a mob that famously chased Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman through the Senate wing of the building. Another, Annie Howell, told a judge she met with the select committee four times.

By Julien Emile-Geay

USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences

By now, few people question the reality that humans are altering Earth’s climate. The real question is: How quickly can we halt, even reverse, the damage?

Part of the answer to this question lies in the concept of “committed warming,” also known as “pipeline warming.”

It refers to future increases in global temperatures that will be caused by greenhouse gases that have already been emitted. In other words, if the clean energy transition happened overnight, how much warming would still ensue?

Earth’s Energy Budget Out of Balance

Humans cause global warming when their activities emit greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the lower atmosphere, preventing it from escaping out to space.

Before people began burning fossil fuels to power factories and vehicles and raising methane-emitting cattle in nearly every arable region, Earth’s energy budget was roughly in balance. About the same amount of energy was coming in from the Sun as was leaving.

Today, rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere are more than 50 percent higher than they were at the dawn of the industrial age, and they’re trapping more of that energy.

Those carbon dioxide emissions, together with other greenhouse gases such as methane, and offset by some aspects of aerosol air pollution, are trapping energy equivalent to the detonation of five Hiroshima-style atomic bombs per second.

With more energy coming in than leaving, Earth’s thermal energy increases, raising the temperature of land, oceans and air and melting ice.

Warming in the Pipeline

The effects of tampering with Earth’s energy balance take time to show up. Think of what happens when you turn the hot water faucet all the way up on a cold winter day: The pipes are full of cold water, so it takes time for the warm water to get to you – hence the term “pipeline warming.” The warming hasn’t been felt yet, but it is in the pipeline.

There are three major reasons Earth’s climate is expected to continue warming after emissions stop.

First, the leading contributors to global warming – carbon dioxide and methane – linger in the atmosphere for a long time: about 10 years on average for methane, and a whopping 400 years for carbon dioxide, with some molecules sticking around for up to millennia. So, turning off emissions doesn’t translate into instant reductions in the amount of these heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere.

Second, part of this warming has been offset by man-made emissions of another form of pollution: sulfate aerosols, tiny particles emitted by fossil fuel burning, that reflect sunlight out to space. Over the past century, this global dimming has been masking the warming effect of greenhouse emissions. But these and other man-made aerosols also harm human health and the biosphere. Removing those and short-lived greenhouse gases translates to a few tenths of a degree of additional warming over about a decade, before reaching a new equilibrium.

Finally, Earth’s climate takes time to adjust to any change in energy balance. About two-thirds of Earth’s surface is made of water, sometimes very deep water, which is slow to take up the excess carbon and heat. So far, over 91% of the heat added by human activities, and about a quarter of the excess carbon, have gone into the oceans. While land-dwellers may be grateful for this buffer, the extra heat contributes to sea level rise through thermal expansion and also marine heat waves, while the extra carbon makes the ocean more corrosive to many shelled organisms, which can disrupt the ocean food chain.

Earth’s surface temperature, driven by the imbalance of radiant energy at the top of the atmosphere, and modulated by the enormous thermal inertia of its oceans, is still playing catch up with its biggest control knob: carbon dioxide concentration.

How Much Warming?

So, how much committed warming are we in for? There isn’t a clear answer.

The world has already warmed more than 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 F) compared to pre-industrial levels. Nations worldwide agreed in 2015 to try to prevent the global average from rising more than 1.5°C (2.7 F) to limit the damage, but the world has been slow to react.

Determining the amount of warming ahead is complicated. Several recent studies use climate models to estimate future warming. A study of 18 Earth system models found that when emissions were cut off, some continued warming for decades to hundreds of years, while others began cooling quickly. Another study, published in June 2022, found a 42 percent chance that the world is already committed to 1.5 degrees.

The amount of warming matters because the dangerous consequences of global warming don’t simply rise in proportion to global temperature; they typically increase exponentially, particularly for food production at risk from heat, drought and storms.

Further, Earth has tipping points that could trigger irreversible changes to fragile parts of the Earth system, like glaciers or ecosystems. We won’t necessarily know right away when the planet has passed a tipping point, because those changes are often slow to show up. This and other climate-sensitive systems are the basis for the precautionary principle of limiting warming under 2°C (3.6 F), and preferably, 1.5°C.

The heart of the climate problem, embedded in this idea of committed warming, is that there are long delays between changes in human behavior and changes in the climate. While the precise amount of committed warming is still a matter of some contention, evidence shows the safest route forward is to urgently transition to a carbon-free, more equitable economy that generates far less greenhouse gas emissions.

by Ramin Mazaheri for the Saker blog

“The Radicals (Western Liberal Democratic reformists) are the democratic party of French imperialism – any other definition is a lie.” – Trotsky

It is too facile to refute the Western Mainstream media’s “manufactured consent”, to use Noam Chomsky’s famous phrase, which gave overwhelming support to the police brutality and legal repression of the Yellow Vests. They did this by a tactic which has become common in the post-Lisbon Treaty West: calling them a “basket of deplorables”, racists, xenophobes, fascists, homophobes, etc., despite all the abundant evidence to the contrary.

(This is the fourteenth chapter in a new book, France’s Yellow Vests: Western Repression of the West’s Best Values. Please click here for the article which announces this book and explains its goals.)

On October 16, 2022, the Yellow Vests were finally allowed to start what they termed “Season 2”: normal political activity – which had been banned by the coronavirus lockdowns starting in March 2020 – was allowed to be resumed. The pause was welcomed by no global leader more heartily than the embattled Emmanuel Macron. The banner given pride of place to lead the Paris demonstration was of a Muslim woman wearing a hijab and a medical mask.

There had been no conversion during the lockdowns – the Yellow Vests have always been anti-racist.

In July 2020 they had marched to remember the 3rd anniversary of Adama Traore, a young Muslim Black man infamously killed while in police custody.

Yellow Vest: “If you look around here you see people of all colours and religions. For me it goes beyond questions of origin – it’s really a question of social justice, regardless of someone’s ethnicity or religion.”

(Note: this book intersperses over 100 quotations taken from actual, marching Yellow Vests which were originally published in news reports on PressTV.)

In February 2020 they had marched against anti-Semitism. At a previous Yellow Vest march far-right thinker Alain Finkielkraut was called a “dirty Zionist” and was told he was not welcome at Yellow Vest demonstrations. This allowed for an immediate media slander campaign which, shamefully, culminated in Emmanuel Macron’s criminalisation of anti-Zionism (opposition to the colonialist political project to create Israel) by falsely conflating it with anti-Semitism (opposition to Jews and Judaism). The irony was that just three months earlier Macron had caused international shock by publicly praising the anti-Semitic leader of Nazi-collaborating Vichy France, Philippe Pétain. In 2014 France had became the first country ever to ban pro-Palestinian marches. France has the world’s third-largest Jewish population, and even though French Muslims outnumber them around 10 to 1 there is no comparison between the two political and cultural influence of the two groups.

Yellow Vest: “The French media wants to make people believe that Yellow Vests are anti-Semitic because they insulted Alain Finkielkraut, but the vast majority of Yellow Vests are in favor of solidarity and against any form of racism. Yellow Vests are here tonight to say we are against anti-Semitism.”

Not that the French mainstream media cares about French Muslims, but many French commentators accused the Yellow Vests of being Islamophobic because they didn’t have enough Muslims marching with them, they insisted. It was a false claim. The problem is that these commentators were looking for Muslim caricatures, not French Muslims. They wanted to see burqas, beards, African clothing and signs in Arabic – but these types of Muslims are not representative of the average Muslim in France. The same accusation against Muslims during the “Je suis Charlie” march was also made, but many Muslims protested then as well. Anyway, Muslims are a small minority in France, relatively equal to the number of those with red hair.

The most important reason why Muslims may have hesitated from marching with the Yellow Vests is because they would have certainly been the first victims of police brutality. A group of dark-skinned people with Yellow Vests standing together would be like waving a red flag at the idiotic bulls and bullies who are French CRS riot cops (Compagnies républicaines de sécurité – Republican Security Companies). Thus, an absolutely vital concept which the Yellow Vests proved to France is that police brutality is not just against the Adama Traores of France, but that police brutality is rooted in class oppression above all. The Yellow Vests proved – emphatically – what non-Whites (and the United Nations, and countless NGOs, and countless protesters) had said for years: French police brutality is among the worst in the world.

Yellow Vest: “I didn’t suffer from police or state repression because I am White and because I don’t live in a poor area, but because I joined the Yellow Vests demonstrations I have now suffered from police violence. This issue (of police violence) concerns everyone.”

When Emmanuel Macron put the idea of immigration at the centre of his Great National Debate – even though it figured nowhere among the demands of the Yellow Vests – the goal was twofold: the classic Liberalist/fascist obsession with identity politics, and also to maintain the false link between xenophobia and the Yellow Vests, i.e. guilt by association. Liberalist elite now insist that they are supreme not because of royal blood, but because of their incredibly decent blood – thus, the poor must portrayed as embittered people with closed minds who want to close off their communities.

Yellow Vest: “From the beginning of the movement they have tried to slander us as racists, xenophobes and crazy people, and now they are trying to accuse of being anti-Semitic. All around the country there were marches this week against anti-Semitism, but the media only covered Paris and ignored the anti-racism marches in small towns.”

I could go on and on with actual proofs and quotes of the anti-xenophobia efforts of the Yellow Vests, because I was there so often, but this discussion is entirely false to begin with.

At the beginning the Yellow Vests were as heterogenous as France itself, so of course it went across the entire spectrum, from the far-left to the far-right. The only class which refused to join were the bourgeois bloc – Macronistas and blinkered Europhiles. The two previous chapters fully described the characteristics and composition of the Yellow Vests, revealing no allegiance, ideological ties or even Facebook chatter which inclines to the far-right. Academics found that the Yellow Vest demands resembled the political party France Insoumise (Unsubmissive France Party). This is a political party which is invariably labelled as “far-left” and “extreme left” in the mainstream media (although I rank them as simply “left”), and which is led by Jean-Luc Melenchon, who to the mainstream media is invariably a “far-left firebrand”. How can this be true and yet the Yellow Vests are also right-wing xenophobes? They are leftist in economic and political ideology yet far-right racists in cultural matters? What an absurdity and falsehood!

It is an outright lie, but the dearth of reporting on the Yellow Vests means that most people are operating on total ignorance regarding the Yellow Vests, and on the realities of Western Liberal Democracy in general.

What’s more necessary to ask is: why are the slander campaigns necessary?

Firstly, it must noted that the slander of the Yellow Vests as racist xenophobes was more often seen in the Anglosphere than in France, due to the latter’s decreased obsession with race/tribalism. Within France the most common slander was actually that they were just stupid hooligans or wreckers (casseurs). Identity politics – and the ability to lay a (mostly race-based) guilt-trip on the White working poor – simply doesn’t work as well in France as in the Anglosphere, thankfully, but that’s not to say it makes no inroads at all. This greater resilience is due to France’s history of 1789- and socialist-inspired egalitarianism, which necessarily produces an undoubtedly more intelligent political culture overall than in the English-speaking world.

Both types of calumny were used for the same reasons: to distract from the failures of Liberalism, and of the pan-European project, to manufacture support for Western Liberal Democracy’s 1%-centred political agenda, and for its false electoral tactics that serve as a safety valve for actual political progress.

The Yellow Vests sought to put the issues of the working poor and of the working class back at the front of the media and political agenda. Thus, their only “xenophobic” crime was this: fact-based bias against the elite minority.

To use nonsensical Western terms: it is ‘xenophobia’ to question the rule of the 1%

Thus a primary conclusion we must draw from the Yellow Vest experience is that Western Liberal Democracy will portray anyone who tries to put economic issues on the agenda as being fascistic.

Just as crucially, they will emphasise only the xenophobia of 1930s fascism while totally omitting the anti-Liberalist, anti-Bankocracy aspects of 1930s fascism.

The point of chapters 7 and 8, discussing the 1930s, was to make it clear that Western politics has never reconciled (has never wanted to reconcile) with the arrival, meaning and legacy of fascism. Those groups came to power because they publicly and correctly condemned the oligarchic and autocratic nature of Western Liberal Democracy, which was gleaned from their acceptance of Marxist-inspired analyses of 19th century politics and economics. However, they irrevocably broke with Marxism by replacing the international brotherhood of the class struggle with a self-worshipping and competitive xenophobia. Precisely because fascists (like so many socialists) assumed that Western Liberal Democracy had been irrevocably discredited by the modern industrial horrors of imperialism (such as those of the French Third Republic), by World War I, by the Great Depression etc., they concentrated their efforts on crushing socialism in the USSR – Western Liberal Democracy was already smashed, they assumed. When they failed the fascists were eagerly subsumed by Western Liberal Democracies because they always, of course, sought to smash socialism, anti-imperialism and the working class worldwide in order to maintain the “bourgeois” power of only-recently ousted royals, high finance, industrialists and their “talented tenth” of sycophants. A major reason why Westerners cannot comprehend their own contemporary and 20th century politics is because they fail to remember that Western Liberal Democracy was broadly considered the most “evil” prior to World War II, and they are now kept in the historical and ideological dark regarding Western Liberal Democracy’s subsuming of fascism via the most false propaganda regarding it’s 1%-focused ideology. This brief but accurate retelling of 20th century Western historical development helps us understand why Western politics in the 2020s is so very similar to the 1930s – we are constantly being warned of a “fascist” threat which is not “fascist”.

The enormous contemporary difference is that – thanks to the socialist-led anti-segregation, anti-apartheid and anti-racism movements, as well as the much maligned lens of “political correctness” – racism and xenophobia has been decreased to the point where pogroms are no longer possible in the West (and in a West now often reconstituted thanks to unprecedented immigration). There will be no mass murder of Muslims in France, to give one example – too many non-Muslims would come to their aid. Morality has changed, just as morality changed in the 19th century to ban slavery. Xenophobia as a political ideology has lost in the heart of the average Western person – it is only the Western Liberal Democratic 1% which keeps xenophobia going.

It is kept going by the bourgeois bloc-elite because a hysterical fear-mongering against a “fascism” which is not even fascism – which carries no threat of Germanic genocides but all the corporate-government alliance which fascism promoted economically (as opposed to the worker empowerment and egalitarianism of Socialist Democracy) – has proven to be an effective electoral and capitalistic culture tactic to prevent the century-long delayed revolution against Western Liberal Democracy.

The Yellow Vests implicitly call for just such a revolution – thus they had to be deemed “fascist”: they pointed out the failures of Western Liberal Democracy, which this book has proven has existed since its very inception in 1848, and back to its 1688 roots in oligarchic English parliamentarianism.

The electoral tactic is a repeat of the failed safety valve in 1936 France – the “People’s Front”, an alliance of all parties centre and left (and now green, too) in order to keep the scourge of fascism at bay. In the 21st century this new coalition is twice as retarding of social progress than the one in the 1930s because it is not even half as leftist – Chapter 9 was based around proving how the French leftist elites have been swayed by Liberalism and have given up actual leftism.

I call this new ideology “PFAXIsm”, and it is what Western fake-leftists have incessantly called for since 2016 (which is when the travesty of the 2008 Financial Crisis and the Great Recession began to be registered in the political ideologies and votes of many Westerners, such as with Brexit and the election of Donald Trump): a “Popular Front for Anti-Xenophobic Imperialism”. It is pronounced very similar to “fascism” for an obvious reason.

This acronym describes the paradox of someone marching against xenophobia, but doing so upon the corpses perpetually caused by capitalism-imperialism. By not only rejecting Socialist Democracy but even much of mere Social Democracy modern Western politics sees their “righteous” elite marching against xenophobia while also marching their lower classes off to distant capitalist-imperialist war. The proofs of this are too legion to mention. PFAXism is the result of neutering leftism of any demand for redistributing political power and wealth while insisting that non-Whites and non-heterosexuals get an (allegedly) equal chance to climb up to the Liberalist 1% elite.

This is not progressive politics.

The fact that one can be the most rabid “neoliberal” while being also anti-xenophobic shows that anti-xenophobia cannot provide the foundation of a leftist, progressive political doctrine.

The most false claim by PFAXists is that they are “tolerant and inclusive” of minorities, but they are only tolerant of minorities who share their Liberalist views. Thus, they are not tolerant at all – they are actually fighting class warfare, and their class is that of the elite.

Above all, PFAXism is being pushed precisely because of Western Liberal Democracy’s struggle to keep from being completely fascistic: The only legacy Western Liberal Democracy wants to keep from socialism is anti-xenophobia, but they cannot because xenophobia is an inescapable component of imperialist capitalism, while elitism is an inescapable component of Western Liberal Democracy

The undemocratic installation of the pan-European project, the brutality against the Yellow Vests and the rollback of Social Democracy prove the accuracy of these contemporary conclusions.

Thus a good definition of Western “fake-leftism” during the Yellow Vest era was to being flailing wildly, ignorantly and falsely about fake fascism (and Russian interference for any anti-“neoliberal” development) in order to distract from the obvious errors, inequalities and autocracies of Western Liberal Democracy.

A “progressive politics” which must rely on wilfully ignoring the crimes of Western Liberal Democracy is by definition not progressive, and any other definition is a lie.

The Yellow Vests smashed PFAXIsm just as they re-discredited Western Liberal Democracy

Just as modern Western Liberal Democracy cannot or will not define fascism properly, they also cannot identify what true Western leftism is even while watching it getting beat up by cops every Saturday. Just as Edmund Burke and the Whigs falsely insisted that they were still the true progressives in 1789 – despite being Rights of Man-denying sycophants to pro-monarchy oligarchs – so do modern Western fake-leftists falsely insist the same, totally behind the times.

This why what Trotsky wrote about France in the 1930s remains a valid electoral analysis today, and even across the West.

“The whole meaning of the present political situation resides in the fact that the despairing petty bourgeoisie (the small businessman class) is beginning to break from the yoke of parliamentary discipline and from the tutelage of the conservative ‘Radical’ (i.e. Liberal Reformist) clique, which has always fooled the people and which has now definitely betrayed it. To join in this situation with the Radicals (Reformists) means to condemn oneself to the scorn of the masses and to push the petty bourgeoisie into the embrace of fascism as its sole saviour. The working class party must occupy itself not with a hopeless effort to save the party of the bankrupts. It must, on the contrary, with all its strength, accelerate the process of liberation of the masses from Radical (Reformist) influence.” (emphasis mine)

The entire problem of contemporary Western politics – with its schizophrenic inability to accurately define “left”, “right”, “fascism”, “Nazi”, “socialism”, etc. – has just been summarised: Not understanding that any party in favor of Western Liberal Democracy is a party of the bankrupts.

Trotsky, socialists, fascists and even the average European knew this in the 1930s but the message has been obscured and forgotten. This concept also provides the best explanation for the domestic popularity of the Yellow Vests in France: they refused to associate with any of the “party of the bankrupts” of the re-discredited French political establishment.

Western Liberal Democracy has waged propaganda wars that it was redeemed by winning World War II. Even though the socialist USSR and China paid the overwhelming costs for victory, somehow the war provided redemption for the Western Liberal Democratic horrors of industrial imperialism, World War I and the Great Depression. It’s preposterous propaganda, of course. The return of Liberalism in the mid-1970s to roll back mere Social Democracy, to impose the undemocratic pan-European project and the repression of the Yellow Vests has emphatically reminded that Western Liberal Democracy remains the party of the bankrupts.

Must we have a World War III, a 2nd Great Depression and new era of horrific neo-imperialism to remind us of this inevitable conclusion?!

The Yellow Vests are so vital because they refused to save the party of the bankrupts, which meant they rendered totally impotent the mystifying absurdities and the obscuration of the class struggle inherent in PFAXist ideas. Just as one can retort, “the Yellow Vests” to a Western Liberal Democrat who claims the moral high ground over other political ideologies, one can also retort “the Yellow Vests” to Westerners who claim all “populist” movements are far-right xenophobes. These are two major, major achievements.

The Trump movement in the US could never have achieved that: Trump is a completely fascist leader. He is akin to Adolf Hitler in that Hitler also rejected typical imperialism – his invasions were to gather all the Germanic peoples into one Germanic-only superstate. Hitler famously refused to be bought off by Paris and London with their offers of some of their non-White colonies – he wanted to annex only Germanic areas. Trump was the least belligerent American president since World War II, and his diplomatic overtures to North Korea and Russia (strangled in the cradle by Russiagate – the disproven allegations of Trump’s ties to the Kremlin) sent the Western Liberal Democratic elite into an unprecedented fury. Trump generated enormous global popularity mainly due to his rejection of the globalist wing of Western Liberal Democracy and foreign war, but his progressive political bonafides are scant because, again, fascism is only slightly better than Western Liberal Democracy. The US ultimately has zero interest in political reforms – they are the modern day Whigs in their deluded insistence that they are the world’s most truly progressive nation.

The Leave movement in Brexit was a typically British affair in its insularity and it in its latently conservative – and not ardently progressive – motivations. Looking over at a continent in economic and political chaos in 2016, and having a press honest enough to admit the undemocratic basis of the pan-European project (though not being in the euro gave them the most necessary latitude), did indeed produce a progressive and self-preserving result for the UK. It did inspire calls for other nations to leave the EU, which is also progressive. However, simply “-exiting” is not enough: it provides no example for countries not in Europe, for example. This was merely a one-issue movement, after all.

It’s vital to recall that “American fascism” and “English oligarchy” was never discredited as was fascism on the Continent – they helped win World War II, were never conquered even partially and never fully colluded. Only the intensely racist parts in the US were eventually discredited (thus the end of Jim Crow), as were the intensely autocratic/elitist/pro-monarchy parts of the UK (thus the long, long-delayed acceptance of republicanism within the British Commonwealth, which was established by the London Declaration of 1949, marking the formal beginning of the modern Commonwealth).

But this also means that for decades – quite significantly – there has never been honest discussion about fascism in the US and UK. This is evidenced by the fact that, unlike on the Continent, for decades there was no “anti-fascist” political fight in either Anglophone imperialist nation because they falsely assume that Western Liberal Democracy is inherently anti-fascist. Indeed, “fascism” only became a domestic problem in these two countries in 2016! In a world which has become more and more Anglophone and dominated by Anglophone culture their 1% neo-aristocratic/bourgeois had never been stopped until 2016.

However, the world understands politics well enough to understand that both nations are totally incapable of leading a truly progressive and internationalist movement, no matter how much these two nations falsely believe their own propaganda.

The Yellow Vests, however, were not just a one-issue social movement but a social revolt. The left-wing, transnational basis of this revolt became immediately apparent – they were emulated in over two dozen countries. The sale of Yellow Vests had to be banned in Egypt, where the West shamefully helped topple the progressive 2011 Revolution because it progressively demanded a role for Islam in politics.

Had the Yellow Vests not come along who or what would have provided such an easy, accurate retort to the Western Liberal Democratic and PFAXIst claim that all “populist” movements are far-right xenophobes?

The Yellow Vests are primarily an economic movement: taxes, lack of public services, high cost of products of premier necessity – this is the basis of the protest. Contrarily, there is no economic basis of PFAXIsm, thus they are not compatible with the Yellow Vests. PFAXIsm does not care about the incapacity of Western Liberal Democracy to care about the economic concerns of the working poor and middle classes.

The political foundation of the Yellow Vests is the anti-democratic autocracy which has been employed since 2009. Many Yellow Vests do not yet comprehend that Western Liberal Democracy has never cared about the economic and democratic concerns of the working poor and middle classes – this book aims to rectify their misperceptions of history.

(For the record: in the quote of Trotsky above I replaced the word “Radical” with “Reformist” because the Radical Party was anti-socialist, anti-communist and allied with the bourgeois to the hilt. Their name stems from the era when even mere Western Liberal Democracy and republicanism were still considered to be radical. The party was founded in 1901 – it’s the oldest active political party in France today, and now on the right-wing – back when when Germanic emperors and kings still ruled autocratically, and thus Liberalist rights for those outside of the aristocratic oligarchy were still “radical”. After only a few years, and amid the rise of socialism, they were quickly re-placed further and further on the right of the political spectrum. Their slogan was “Neither reaction nor revolution!” Thus, what could be a better term than mere, inadequate “Reformist”?)

What is the political choice for Yellow Vests and their supporters in a PFAXIst society?

Because of the dominance of PFAXIsm, which attempts to hide how Western Liberal Democracy has subsumed much of fascism, Trotsky’s concern in 1936 that the French would be pushed “into the embrace of fascism as its sole saviour” is no longer applicable.

Western Liberal Democracy has joined with fascism – from ex-Nazis in Western German to “3rd-generation Nazis” in Ukraine – and this is something which would have been difficult for Trotsky to accurately predict. It would have been difficult in large part because he conflated “Bonapartism” with “Liberalism”, even though the two are different and were opposed to each other: the former having genuine grassroots, and thus democratic, support and the latter never really having it.

No politician in France is offering even the semi-socialist analysis offered by fascism anymore: Marine Le Pen’s neo-National Socialism in 2017 was replaced in the 2022 election campaign with a reversion to “neoliberalism”, acceptance of high finance and dead-end reformism for the pan-European project.

PFAXIsm thus can reign forever in the West: Citizens can forever tune in to find scapegoating (In France: of Muslims) or they can find a scapegoating of the scapegoaters, but they will never find what the Yellow Vests are talking about: redistribution of economic and political power, which would be the only way to end the inequalities the scapegoaters of scapegoaters claim to care about. There is no way out if one foolishly accepts the greatly similar tenets of PFAXIsm, fascism or Western Liberal Democracy.

All experiences of Popular Fronts – an alliance with elements of the ruling class – have ended in shameful defeat, and 2022 will be no different in France. The Nouvelle Union Populaire écologique et sociale (NUPES – the New People’s Ecologic and Social Union) gathered together the communists, socialists, greens, Melenchon’s leftist France Insoumise and the smaller leftist parties (but not the Trotskyists). The goal is to break Macron’s absolute control over Parliament and to deny the far-right a greater share. The latter was immediately, and foolishly, deemed the more important goal: on the night of his presidential first round loss Melenchon roared “not one vote” for Le Pen in the second round, and immediately began a foolish and certain-to-fail campaign to be Macron’s prime minister. Polls show Macron’s En Marche party winning 55% of the National Assembly this month – that’s seemingly a slight absolute majority, but here’s the kicker: the conservatives (which En Marche should be truly classed with) are polling at 20%, and thus Liberalist deforms will roll over a NUPES alliance which is polling to win just 20% of parliament.

In 2022 NUPES will prove to be much like 1936. As Trotsky wrote: “a classic definition of the People’s Front: A safety valve for the mass movement.”

NUPES will end in failure, disappointment and discredit, as popular fronts – an alliance with elements of the ruling class – always do. Thus Chapter 7 – Where the West is stuck: The fascism of the 1930s and the ‘fascism’ of the 2020s – was both a prescient prediction of the formation of NUPES and an explanation of its certain failure. Hope you’re glad you read that chapter – when the final legislative results are announced on June 19 you’ll be ready!

But it is undoubtedly due to the discrediting example of the Yellow Vests that France’s left was forced to do something different, finally. This was the first leftist coalition since the Socialist Party-dominated “Plural Left”, which won control over Parliament in 1997. However, all the “party of the bankrupts” could offer and achieve was a bankrupt strategy and bankrupt results, again. The upcoming chapter on the unions will point out how the discrediting example of the Yellow Vests forced the unions to actually do something – launch a general strike – but with a similarly wilfully bankrupt strategy and results.

Trotsky promoted something different than the Popular Front: the united front, which is mobilisation of the working class independent of the ruling class and its political parties. This is essentially what the Yellow Vests are, obviously. Indeed, it’s so telling that today’s Trotskyists are so lost and discredited that they cannot or will not ally with the Yellow Vests.

Trotsky speculated what a good united front would actually aim to do:

“The united front does not renounce parliamentary struggle but it utilises parliament above all to unmask is impotence, and to explain to the people that the present government has an extra-parliamentary base, and that it can be overthrown only by a powerful mass movement.”

Only a Yellow Vest party would actually do this in French parliament, not any of the NUPES alliance. The entire history of Western Liberal Democracy is to hide or paper over its oligarchy, which is to say that “extra-parliamentary base” which undemocratically controls policy.

The failure of France’s “leftist” Popular Front in the late 1930s proved that Western Liberal Democracy would never cooperate with any kind of leftism, even fake-leftism. Thus, fascism came to power because the average European realised that Western Liberal Democracy is a perpetual dead-end. Fascism’s arrival was only by (foreign-aided) force in Spain – everywhere else it was due to popular acceptance that Liberalism was nothing but autocratic and plutocratic oligarchy.

Trotsky wrote of France: “The policy of coalition with the bourgeoisie must be paid for by the proletariat with years of new torments and sacrifices, if not by decades of fascist terror.”

What Trotsky could not have foreseen is the crucial reality I keep stressing: Western Liberal Democracy has subsumed fascism, thus decades of fascist terror by France and the West has been the global reality long after the 1930s. Thus 2027 cannot be a repeat of 1940 even if Marine Le Pen wins, as many expect, because her “fascism” is not fascism at all. Human history is not uselessly cyclical but linear: as much as PFAXIsm wants to insist otherwise, post-2016 “fascism” is simply not the same as 1930s fascism.

“On the other hand, if we continue to mark time, the pre-revolutionary situation will inevitably be changed into one of counterrevolution, and will bring on the victory of fascism, ” wrote Trotsky, correctly. However, almost a century later the analysis must incorporate the political changes since then: if the French merely tread water from the Yellow Vests’ creation of a pre-revolutionary situation then fascism will continue its long victory streak in the West.

In between the first and second rounds of the 2017 election I promoted Macron as the worse choice between him and Le Pen. I was proven totally right that Macron was not some friend of anti-racism/pro-Muslim movements. I was also proven totally right that Macron was as authoritarian as a fascist – simply look at the Yellow Vests, the normalisation of the state of emergency and his autocratic governing methods.

In between the first and second rounds of the 2022 election I also promoted a vote of Le Pen over Macron. Once again it was the only progressive gain which could have been made: Giving Le Pen power would have shown that Western Liberal Democracy is elitist, fascist and awful. Donald Trump discredited “Western Liberal Democracy with American characteristics” in a supremely effective way – by re-electing Macron France has merely postponed its similarly honest examination of what their system really is: both fascist and PFAXIst.

❖

The last few days in the United States have seen a parade of wealthy freaks fellating each other’s egos and preening for the cameras in outlandish garb while ordinary Americans suffer more and more.

The weekend’s White House Correspondents’ Dinner saw a gaggle of media celebrities congregate to congratulate one another on what a great job they’ve been doing bravely telling the truth and holding the most powerful government on earth to account. The host, Trevor Noah of The Daily Show, gushed with enthusiasm about how much freedom the press have in America to say things the powerful don’t like.

I’ve always respected @Trevornoah so much but this closing speech from the White House correspondents’ dinner is particularly spectacular. pic.twitter.com/k8GmBOAoYB — Mike Birbiglia (@birbigs) May 1, 2022

“As we sit in this room tonight, people, I really hope you all remember what the real purpose of this evening is,” Noah said. “Yes, it’s fun. Yes, we dress nice. Yes, the people eat, they drink, we have fun. But the reason we’re here is to honor and celebrate the fourth estates and what you stand for — what you stand for — an additional check and balance that holds power to account and gives voice to those who otherwise wouldn’t have one.”

“And if you ever begin to doubt your responsibilities, if you ever begin to doubt how meaningful it is, look no further than what’s happening in Ukraine,” said Noah. “Look at what’s happening there. Journalists are risking and even losing their lives to show the world what’s really happening. You realize how amazing it is. In America, you have the right to seek the truth and speak the truth even if it makes people in power uncomfortable, even if it makes your viewers or your readers uncomfortable. You understand how amazing that is? I stood here tonight and I made fun of the president of the United States, and I’m going to be fine. I am going to be fine, right? Do you really understand what a blessing it is?”

Of course there are people who’ve said things that US presidents don’t like who are not in fact fine. Julian Assange continues to waste away in Belmarsh Prison as the US government continues its efforts to extradite him to he can become the first publisher ever tried under the Espionage Act. Edward Snowden, an American, remains in exile because one US president after another continues to refuse to pardon his heroic whistleblowing about the sinister surveillance practices of the US intelligence cartel. Daniel Hale, also an American, sits in prison for exposing the depravity of America’s monstrous drone program.

Trevor Noah: ""In the US you have the right to speak the truth even if it makes the people in power uncomfortable."" In 2021 Daniel Hale was sentenced to 45 months in prison for exposing that in Afghanistan, 90% of the victims of US airstrikes were civilians. https://t.co/rs4i0wPPSU — Friendly Neighborhood Comrade (@SpiritofLenin) May 2, 2022

Trevor Noah did not mention these people, or the many others who’ve been persecuted, silenced, imprisoned and killed for saying things the powerful individuals who govern the US don’t approve of, because as a member of the mainstream media his job is not to inform but to propagandize.

Far from providing “an additional check and balance that holds power to account and gives voice to those who otherwise wouldn’t have one” as Noah claims, the people in his audience on Saturday night are tasked with manipulating public thought in facilitation of the interests of the powerful. The mainstream news media in America, and throughout all the so-called free democracies of the western world, are propaganda institutions whose first and foremost job is to manufacture consent for oligarchy and empire.

Which is why the President of the United States, when he took the podium that night, had nothing but friendly words for the mainstream press.

“What’s clear, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, is that you, the free press, matter more than you ever did in the last century,” Biden said. “We’ve all seen the courage of Ukrainian people because of the courage of American reporters in this room, and your colleagues across the world who are on the ground taking their lives in their own hands.”

Congratulations to US journalists for doing nothing but produce coverage that the White House absolutely loves https://t.co/ToTnPZBlXs — Michael Tracey (@mtracey) May 1, 2022

This past weekend also saw a friendly gathering of brave fourth estate truth warriors and political and government operatives of the US empire at a party hosted by the billionaire owner of the neocon war propaganda rag The Atlantic.

Politico reports:

David and Katherine Bradley and Laurene Powell Jobs hosted a dinner at the Bradleys’ home. SPOTTED: Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Cabinet Secretary Evan Ryan, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, CIA Director Bill Burns, press secretary Jen Psaki, Deputy A.G. Lisa Monaco, Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.), FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel, Del. Stacey Plaskett (D-U.S. Virgin Islands), homeland security adviser Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, Jeffrey Goldberg, Nick Thompson, Peter Lattman, Anne Applebaum, Russell Berman, Franklin Foer, David Frum, Elaine Godfrey, Adam Harris, Mark Leibovich, Jeff Dufour, Heather Kuldell, Kevin Baron, José Andrés, Enes Kanter, Mitch Landrieu, Dafna Linzer, Rachel Martin, Judy Woodruff, Jake Tapper, Wolf Blitzer, Jonathan Capehart, Katty Kay, Steve and Jean Case, John Dickerson and Jen Palmieri.

Yep, when you see a shady basketball player/empire propagandist fraternizing with the CIA Director while surrounded by media celebrities and government insiders at a party hosted by a media-owning plutocrat, you know you’re in a country where power is held to account. Right, Trevor?

Had a great conversation with the

Director of @CIA William J. Burns Thank you for your friendship pic.twitter.com/qGGHympg4o — Enes FREEDOM (@EnesFreedom) April 30, 2022

The orgy of embarrassment was capped off by the 2022 Met Gala, a big weird dystopian parade of rich freaks dressed like Hunger Games aristocracy and laughing in the face of everyone who can’t afford to live.

An honest Met Gala dress would have a corset made from the bones of Yemeni children, draped with a cloth of stolen gold and lithium spun by the tiny hands of child slaves, with a full-length train that leached oil and blood wherever it went.

finding out roe v wade is overturned in between regurgitations of images of celebrities @ the met gala…feels very american! — norman (@emonormie) May 3, 2022

This while ordinary Americans struggle just to survive. While American women appear to be on the precipice of losing their reproductive sovereignty. While money is poured into a proxy war which threatens to escalate into a conflict that could easily end all life on earth.

This is your dying empire, America. This is your end-stage capitalism. This is your dystopia, in all its weird, phony, stupid glory.

It is horrifying. The longer you look at it, the creepier it gets.

We just sent $33 billion in militarized aid to Ukraine. Meanwhile, here is Philadelphia. pic.twitter.com/fxuKbcqg9k — Kathryn Rose Fisher (@kayrosef) May 1, 2022

Breathe it all in, folks.

We’re in for a hell of a ride.

As the national average for a gallon of gas climbs toward $5, new government data to be released Friday is expected to show that inflation remained at a 40-year high in May. Inflation could clock in close to the March peak of 8.5 percent, compared with the year before, in the latest snapshot from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, known as the consumer price index. The inflation benchmark eased slightly in April, giving policymakers some nascent hope that inflation had finally peaked. However, there are few signs that it has dropped in a meaningful way, raising the urgency for policymakers to rein in prices.

“March inflation may have been the peak, but it’s likely to be a rocky peak,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.

If anything, the stunning run-up in gas prices has become one of the most visceral ways people feel inflation in their daily lives. In some parts of the country, particularly on the West Coast, it’s becoming more common to drop $100 to fill up a gas tank. The national average has set a record every day since May 28, according to AAA, although prices are still below 2008 levels, when adjusted for inflation.

Rising gas prices, plus the cost of rent, airfare, groceries and practically everything else, have put pressure on the Biden administration and Federal Reserve to stabilize inflation.

The Biden administration has declared inflation its top economic priority and has taken steps to lower prices at the pump, by tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and allowing blended biofuels to be sold. President Biden has largely blamed the surge on the Russian invasion in Ukraine, dubbing it “Putin’s price hike” that is spilling over into all sorts of sectors beyond energy and food, namely airfares.

“The fingerprints of that war and Russia’s choices are going to be all over the number,” one senior White House official said.

But for everyday drivers, gas prices act as a kind of billboard for the rising cost of living.

“We’re in uncharted territory,” said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. He added that “it’s not something that’s going to turn around anytime soon, I’m afraid.”

Most Americans expect inflation to get worse in the next year and are adjusting their spending habits in response to rising prices, according to a poll conducted by The Washington Post and George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government. That kind of psychological toll is one of the reasons inflation has become a major political threat to Biden and congressional Democrats going into the midterms this year.

Friday’s data also comes amid growing fears of stunted economic growth worldwide. On Tuesday, the World Bank slashed its annual global growth forecast to 2.9 percent, from January’s 4.1 percent, and warned that the global economy may suffer from 1970s-style stagflation, a dangerous combination of weak growth and rising prices. And on Thursday, the European Central Bank announced it will raise interest rates at its July meeting by a quarter of a percentage point in its fight against inflation.

Much depends on whether the Federal Reserve manages to cool down the economy without acting so forcefully that it causes a recession. The Fed is on a path to raising interest rates seven times this year and will enact the third of those hikes coming next week. It is expected to raise rates by half a percentage point, similar to its May meeting, signaling aggressive moves are needed to keep inflation from becoming more persistent and entrenched in the economy.

There are some encouraging signs. Used-car prices — which made up a bulk of inflation for much of the past year — have fallen in recent months and are expected to continue dropping as semiconductor shortages improve. The red-hot housing market is also starting to cool, as a run-up in mortgage rates discourages aspiring buyers from competing for the few homes available.

There are also limits to what the Fed can do to curb rising prices. Interest rate hikes cannot boost oil supply, bring more people into the labor market or end a war. Energy prices around the world have been rising for months, a reflection of the continuing ripple effects from Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine.

And though the Fed is in charge of controlling inflation, rising prices have soured Biden’s approval ratings for months and the White House has struggled to convince Americans that the economy is working for them.

At the same time inflation is so high, the labor market is unsustainably hot, with roughly two job openings for every person looking for work. The Fed’s goal is that higher interest rates can slow down hiring by making it more expensive for businesses to invest and hire.

In an interview with CNBC last week, Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard made clear the central bank is a long way from seeing progress.

“I’m going to be looking for a consistent string of data on both the strength of demand, the labor market coming into better balance, and of course, importantly, a string of decelerating inflation data to feel more confident,” she said.

Scientists have found microplastics in fresh Antarctic snow for the first time in a study they say highlights “the extent of plastic pollution globally.” Researchers at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand collected snow samples from 19 sites in Antarctica, and all contained the tiny plastics, according to the peer-reviewed paper published this week in the journal Cryosphere.

The research revealed an average of 29 microplastic particles per liter of melted snow. Of the 13 types of plastics, the most common was polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which is used to manufacture clothes and soda bottles.

When PhD student Alex Aves went to Antarctica to collect the samples in 2019, “we were optimistic that she wouldn’t find any microplastics in such a pristine and remote location,” associate professor Laura Revell said Wednesday in a statement. Still, she added, “from the studies published in the last few years, we’ve learned that everywhere we look for airborne microplastics, we find them.”

The minuscule plastic particles, which can come from artificial clothing fibers, broken-down consumer products and other sources, are mostly undetectable to the naked eye — “much smaller than a grain of rice,” as this study describes them.

But from deep oceans to Mount Everest, they have become nearly ubiquitous in a world that generates billions of pounds of plastic waste every year. People can also ingest them in water and food, although their effect on human health is not yet clear.

While prior research has identified the tiny particles in Antarctic sea sediments and surface water, the New Zealand study marks the first time they have been reported in fresh snow, according to the scientists.

The most likely origins of the airborne microplastics are local research stations, from clothing or equipment, although the results also suggest that the particles may have traveled through the air from sources more than 3,700 miles away, they said.

Noting a “growing threat to the Antarctic ecosystem,” the study said microplastics can lead to impaired biological and reproductive functions in exposed organisms, from krill to penguins. It also makes reference to previous findings that the particles deposited on snow or ice caps can speed up melting, in part by absorbing light.

“It’s incredibly sad,” said Aves, the researcher, “but finding microplastics in fresh Antarctic snow highlights the extent of plastic pollution into even the most remote regions of the world.”

Now, healthy young people who suddenly die without any medical explanation are said to have died from Sudden Adult Death Syndrome (SADS) rather than from vaccines.

While SADS has existed in medical terminology long before covid, doctors and the media are now using this syndrome label in a new way: To try to explain away vaccine deaths. From what we can tell so far, there are no such “sudden deaths” in unvaccinated young adults. So far, this seems to be happening solely among those who have been vaccinated.

The UK Daily Mail has published an article detailing this new so-called “syndrome” which is of course just a convenient label to mask the true underlying cause of these sudden deaths. The title of their article is, “Healthy young people are dying suddenly and unexpectedly from a mysterious syndrome – as doctors seek answers through a new national register,” and it says that everyone under the age of 40, “…may potentially be at risk of having Sudden Adult Death Syndrome (SADS).”

All people under the age of 40 are now supposed to “get their hearts checked,” while oblivious doctors claim to be searching for the “genetic cause” behind SADS.

Never before in the history of medicine have doctors and the media urged young people to “get their hearts checked.” This is only happening after the global push for covid vaccines which hijack the body’s cells and force them to create spike protein particles that cause blood clots.

Murderous doctors are killing young people en masse with “clot shots”

You can’t make this up. The medical negligence, incompetence and even maliciousness behind all this is mind-boggling. Medical doctors who function as Big Pharma shills inject young people with gene therapy cocktails containing experimental mRNA sequences that produce spike proteins in the blood, contributing the artificial clotting. In some people, the clots build slowly over time, meaning many people are walking around with partially-formed blood clots in their circulatory system.

Because mRNA injections alter DNA and get incorporated into the genetic code — source: researchers from Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) — some of the body’s cells continue to produce these pro-clotting spike proteins indefinitely. These clotting factors contribute to additional clot formation in the body, resulting in diminished cardiovascular function and — importantly — a reduction of blood flow to the brain, which results in a loss of higher cognitive capabilities. (This is likely why so many vaccinated people have become brain damaged / cognitively retarded and have plunged into animalistic rage emotional processing of the world around them.)

At some point, one or more of the clots in the body completely shuts off the blood circulation necessary to maintain consciousness. At this point, the person loses consciousness and dies. Often this happens when they are driving, flying an airplane or even sleeping at night. This is why so many pilots are dying on the flight deck, for example, which is a major cause contributing to the current nationwide shortage of commercial airline pilots.

A doctor named Dr. Elizabeth Paratz — who claims to be wondering “what genes cause this” syndrome — says that 90 percent of these spontaneous deaths occur outside the hospital. (Source: UK Daily Mail)

Australia is now launching a “SADS registry” to try to solve the mystery of why seemingly healthy adults are spontaneously dying. They are doing this while pushing more mRNA injections onto those very people, apparently oblivious to the fact that mRNA injections are “clot shots.”

It is widely known in the biosciences that viral genetic code is readily and automatically incorporated into human DNA

mRNA injections aren’t even technically vaccines. They are “gene therapy” experimental medicines that alter not just cellular protein synthesis but are even incorporated into human DNA via reverse transcription. It turns out that a significant percentage of human DNA was acquired via this very process over many thousands of generations, where genetic material circulating in the environment is incorporated into human chromosomes. This phenomenon is widely known even in the conventional scientific community.

“Non-retroviral RNA virus sequences have been detected in the genomes of many vertebrate species, including humans,” said biomedical researcher Liguo Zhang from MIT’s Whitehead Institute. (Source: MIT.edu)

Zhang even ran an experiment to test if SATS-CoV-2 viral fragments might incorporate themselves into human DNA:

With this in mind, Zhang and Jaenisch began to design experiments to test whether this viral integration could be happening with the novel coronavirus. With the help of Jaenisch lab postdoc Alexsia Richards, the researchers infected human cells with coronavirus in the lab and then sequenced the DNA from infected cells two days later to see whether it contained traces of the virus’ genetic material.

In all samples, they found fragments of viral genetic material…

In other words, parts of the SARS-CoV-2 were incorporated into the DNA of human cells. Another researcher explains:

“There’s a very clear footprint for LINE1 integration,” Jaenisch says. “At the junction of the viral sequence to the cellular DNA, it makes a 20 base pair duplication.

Anyone claiming spike protein genetic code can’t be incorporated into DNA is flatly ignorant of the state of modern genetic science.

Spike protein mRNA becomes human DNA which turns the body into a clotting factory

As the above experiment shows, when the body is injected with genetic material, some of that material can be incorporated into the chromosomes of living cells. Although this is an oversimplification of the mechanisms in play, the overall result is the same: The body becomes a factory for spike proteins, producing them far beyond the intended time window during which an mRNA vaccine might be expected to function.

In other words, the vaccinated person becomes a walking spike protein factory that can never be turned off. From that point, they become a spike protein shedding machine while increasingly dumping self-synthesized spike proteins into their own circulating blood.

Over time, this forms blood clots. When those clots complete their blockage or large arteries, blood can no longer reach the brain. When the brain has no blood supply, brain death occurs, and the death of the body quickly follows.

This is now being called “Sudden Adult Death Syndrome” even though it’s clearly caused by vaccine-induced blood clots.

Here’s a photo of a blood clot taken from a covid patient. It shows the clotting power of the spike protein, which is also present in covid vaccines:

Billions of people on our planet are now at risk of blood clot-induced sudden death, all by design: Vaccine Depopulation Syndrome

In summary, the murderous medical regime first injects billions of people with a biological weapon that might kill them, then they pretend to be shocked and surprised when so many healthy young adults start dying for no apparent medical reason. Do these medical monsters have no humanity (or scientific credibility) remaining at all?

Although this syndrome is called SADS, what’s really sad is that it was all done on purpose in order to achieve global depopulation. If anything, these deaths should be labeled, “Vaccine Depopulation Syndrome” deaths. But of course the media and the medial tyrants are working triple time to cover all this up, and they know that dead vaccine victims don’t talk, so they can’t tell the living humans to save themselves by avoiding these deadly jabs.

About 58 percent of Russians approve of the invasion of Ukraine, while 23 percent oppose it, according to a poll conducted across Russia a week into Moscow’s full-scale assault. The telephone survey, carried out last week by a group of independent survey research organizations, found relatively modest support for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine compared with typical levels in the early stages of past incursions.

The poll offers rare insight into public opinion in Russia as authorities there crack down on protests against the invasion and stifle independent media coverage.

Gary Langer, a U.S.-based polling expert who runs a research firm, obtained the results of the study from the Russian research organizations and shared them with The Washington Post. He declined to name the Russian firms involved because of the risks they face as Moscow tightens censorship, but said he has partnered previously with the organizations, which he described as “strong, independent survey research firms.”

The national survey was conducted between Feb. 28 and March 1 among a random sample of 1,640 adults across the country. Participants were asked whether they support the Russian military operation on Ukrainian territory. The research firms released the full questionnaire and data set publicly.

About 46 percent of respondents said they firmly supported the action, and about 13 percent said they somewhat supported it. Roughly 23 percent opposed the operation, and 13 percent had no opinion or declined to answer. About 6 percent said they were on the fence.

Among young people, support for the war is significantly lower, according to the study. In the 18-to-24 age group, 29 percent indicated they back the war, while 39 percent were opposed. Peak support for the war, at 75 percent, was among respondents age 66 and older.

Fewer than half of respondents who live in cities of more than 1 million people — 48 percent — supported the invasion. A higher proportion of Russians who reported that their personal finances had improved or remained steady in the past year backed the war, compared with respondents who said their financial situation had worsened.

The results are all the more striking given the dearth of reliable information inside Russia about the invasion and its bloody consequences, Langer said. The Kremlin and state media refer euphemistically to the attack on Ukraine as a “special military action” meant to “liberate” Ukrainians and “denazify” the country.

Truth is difficult to find. Some of the few remaining independent news outlets in Russia have shuttered or suspended operations, and the Kremlin has restricted foreign websites and completely blocked Facebook. A “fake news” law that Putin signed Friday criminalizes contradiction of the official Kremlin line. Merely describing the war as such could lead to a 15-year jail sentence, posing obvious challenges for those seeking to conduct accurate polls there.

“Considering the government control of media and information in Russia, and the natural tendency of populations around the world to rally around their leadership in times of crisis, it is surprising to see this comparatively limited level of support for Putin and his government’s actions,” Langer said.

Before the invasion, as Russian troops massed around Ukraine’s borders, a survey published by the independent Russian polling agency Levada Center found that 56 percent of Russians said a global war was one of their biggest fears.

Still, there is plenty of evidence of public support for the Russian invasion — or at least the absence of widespread criticism. While some Russian celebrities and oligarchs have voiced opposition to the war, and thousands of protesters have been arrested in cities across Russia, other people are celebrating. Outside liberal circles, public criticism has come at a relative trickle.

The results diverge from those of a survey conducted by the government-owned polling firm VCIOM, which says it found 71 percent support for the “decision to conduct a special military operation.” That is compared with 75 percent of Russians who supported Moscow’s military action in Chechnya in 1999 and 91 percent for Putin’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.

Though the VCIOM survey found higher support for the invasion of Ukraine than the independent poll, notable trends emerge from both, Langer said — “those are considerably lower support for the war in Ukraine among younger adults in Russia, among city dwellers and among people who are struggling financially or economically.”

The apparent level of public backing for Russia’s invasion at the start could spell trouble for Putin if the war drags on, Langer said, pointing to the downward trajectory of support for past Russian incursions and American wars in Vietnam and Afghanistan.

“Wars of choice that drag on tend to quickly lose public support,” Langer said. “Add to that the vulnerability of war support when it has not only dreadful human consequences but also broad economic consequences, and you have a recipe for potential difficulty for Putin in terms of maintaining public support moving forward.”

19,https://www.eutimes.net/2022/05/this-misinformation-thing-is-getting-insane-now-turkey-want-to-jail-people-over-misinformation/,"Home » Breaking News, Injustice, Middle East, Suppression » This 'Misinformation' thing is getting INSANE! Now Turkey want to JAIL people over Misinformation

This misinformation thing needs to be stopped. Not only this is total censorship but this literally gives governments unimaginable tyrannical powers of propaganda and control. This needs to be put to end NOW before it continues to spread. This is nonsense. Turkey wants to throw people in jail over “spreading misinformation”? What is “misinformation” in the first place? Who is the master of truth? Who defines what is real and what is false? Why your government of course.

If your government decides to say “No Turkey was never an empire, we never oppressed anyone. The Ottoman empire was a different entity.” and you say, but WE WERE the Ottomans. It was us, not others, not Africans, not Persians, us, here, we Turks, were were the Ottomans.

Well this right here could be “misinformation” and you could be thrown in jail for this. Additionally someone with A FREAKING OPINION about anything could be labled “misinformation”, like “I believe today will not rain even though weather channels say it will rain.” There you go: Misinformation! Jail time for you!

This is fucking insane. People who even propose such laws should be jailed before their vile ideas materialize into reality. Humanity exists for thousands of years yet we never had such insane laws “Censorship and jail for misinformation.” This is only a recent thing, a product of insanity that was given birth in USA specifically by Donald Trump. Trump was the one who invented this crap as he began calling the mainstream media “Fake News” and from this it has evolved into this “misinformation” we have today and it has spread to all corners of the world. We’ve gotten to the point of Turkey jailing people over expressing their “wrong” opinions.

Imagine this… this is a perfect law any dictator wants in its arsenal. A law that says jail over misinformation… what the hell? We need to make a stand and destroy this idea of “government punishment over misinformation.”

Even writing an op-ed or telling a joke, anything could be interpreted as a misinformation. This is bollocks, what they want is to basically: do not deviate from party lines or else.

Give misinformation laws to China.

A Chinese says: My government is sending Uyghurs to concentration camps.

China: NOT TRUE! JAIL FOR YOU!

Give misinformation laws to Iran.

An Iranian says: Life in Iran was better under the Shah and with USA as a partner.

Iran: NOT TRUE! JAIL FOR YOU!

Give misinformation laws to Israel.

An Israelil says: Maybe we should stop occupying West Bank lands. We already took too much.

Israel: NOT TRUE! WE NEVER STOLE ANY LANDS! JAIL FOR YOU!

Give misinformation laws to Canada.

A Canadian says: The truckers were right to protest the vaccination laws. They were oppressive and vaccination should be a CHOICE WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES! Besides COVID is not as dangerous as they say, it only has a death rate of below 1%.

Canadian authorities: NOT TRUE! JAIL FOR YOU!

This is insane! We must put an end to “misinformation laws”. This is not even censorship. This is simply tyranny.

Infowars report:

The Turkish government introduced a new law in parliament that will give the government more control over the internet. The law was drafted by President’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) and its ally the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP).

The law, which is expected to pass, will punish “spreading misinformation on purpose.” It prohibits publicly spreading “false information regarding internal and external security, public order and the general health of the country, in a way that is suitable for disturbing the public peace, simply for the purpose of creating anxiety, fear or panic among the people.”

The punishment for intentionally spreading “false information” will be one to three years in prison. If the court finds that a person spread false information as part of an organization that is illegal, the sentence will be doubled.

Journalists might also be arrested under the new law for hiding sources who gave them “false information.”

Under the new law, web-only media outlets will be allowed to register as periodical media publications. While that makes them enjoy some of the privileges of traditional media, like press cards, they will be required to follow some rules. For instance, they will be required to remove content the government deems false and must archive their publications, which allows the government to more easily block access to their websites.

“On the request of the ministries, the President may decide to remove the content and/or block access to be fulfilled within four hours regarding broadcasts on the internet,” the new law states, referring to the President of the Information and Communication Technologies Authority.

The law also updated the regulations on official press cards. The old regulations, which were created by the Communications Directorate, which answers to the president, gave the government the authority to cancel press cards of journalists who criticized the government.

The new law will create a Press Card Commission, which will have nine members, five from the Communications Directorate and the others will be representatives from journalists’ unions and academics.

The draft bill was severely condemned by journalists. In a joint statement, the Turkish Committee of the International Press Institute, the Journalists’ Association, and the Journalists’ Union of Turkey said that they were “concerned that it may lead to one of the most severe censorship and self-censorship mechanisms in the history of the republic, we call for the immediate withdrawal of this bill, which seems to have been designed to increase the pressure on journalism, not ‘fight against disinformation.”

5,https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61726733,"We've been reporting today on warnings of a potential outbreak of cholera in the occupied southern city of Mariupol.

Cholera can be a very serious illness. In the most severe cases, if left untreated, the disease can kill within hours.

It is caused by a bacterium called Vibrio cholerae and people tend to catch it by eating food or drinking water contaminated with the bug.

The spread of cholera is closely linked to poor sanitation facilities and unsafe drinking water where the bug can thrive and spread.

It is a disease that often adds to the suffering in humanitarian crises – when there is disruption of water and sanitation supplies and people shelter in crowded spaces, with extra pressure on water and sanitation systems.

It takes anywhere between 12 hours and five days for a person to show symptoms after ingesting the contaminated food and water.

Some people get watery diarrhoea and become severely dehydrated. This needs rapid treatment with fluids and antibiotics.

Others get mild to moderate symptoms and many with the disease do not have symptoms at all.

But even when symptom-free they can carry the bug in their faeces for up to 10 days after getting the infection - and it can then be shed back into the environment, with the potential to infect other people.

Cholera vaccines, in combination with improvements in water and sanitation, can help get cholera outbreaks under control.",0

As the national average for a gallon of gas climbs toward $5, new government data to be released Friday is expected to show that inflation remained at a 40-year high in May. Inflation could clock in close to the March peak of 8.5 percent, compared with the year before, in the latest snapshot from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, known as the consumer price index. The inflation benchmark eased slightly in April, giving policymakers some nascent hope that inflation had finally peaked. However, there are few signs that it has dropped in a meaningful way, raising the urgency for policymakers to rein in prices.

“March inflation may have been the peak, but it’s likely to be a rocky peak,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.

If anything, the stunning run-up in gas prices has become one of the most visceral ways people feel inflation in their daily lives. In some parts of the country, particularly on the West Coast, it’s becoming more common to drop $100 to fill up a gas tank. The national average has set a record every day since May 28, according to AAA, although prices are still below 2008 levels, when adjusted for inflation.

Rising gas prices, plus the cost of rent, airfare, groceries and practically everything else, have put pressure on the Biden administration and Federal Reserve to stabilize inflation.

The Biden administration has declared inflation its top economic priority and has taken steps to lower prices at the pump, by tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and allowing blended biofuels to be sold. President Biden has largely blamed the surge on the Russian invasion in Ukraine, dubbing it “Putin’s price hike” that is spilling over into all sorts of sectors beyond energy and food, namely airfares.

“The fingerprints of that war and Russia’s choices are going to be all over the number,” one senior White House official said.

But for everyday drivers, gas prices act as a kind of billboard for the rising cost of living.

“We’re in uncharted territory,” said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. He added that “it’s not something that’s going to turn around anytime soon, I’m afraid.”

Most Americans expect inflation to get worse in the next year and are adjusting their spending habits in response to rising prices, according to a poll conducted by The Washington Post and George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government. That kind of psychological toll is one of the reasons inflation has become a major political threat to Biden and congressional Democrats going into the midterms this year.

Friday’s data also comes amid growing fears of stunted economic growth worldwide. On Tuesday, the World Bank slashed its annual global growth forecast to 2.9 percent, from January’s 4.1 percent, and warned that the global economy may suffer from 1970s-style stagflation, a dangerous combination of weak growth and rising prices. And on Thursday, the European Central Bank announced it will raise interest rates at its July meeting by a quarter of a percentage point in its fight against inflation.

Much depends on whether the Federal Reserve manages to cool down the economy without acting so forcefully that it causes a recession. The Fed is on a path to raising interest rates seven times this year and will enact the third of those hikes coming next week. It is expected to raise rates by half a percentage point, similar to its May meeting, signaling aggressive moves are needed to keep inflation from becoming more persistent and entrenched in the economy.

There are some encouraging signs. Used-car prices — which made up a bulk of inflation for much of the past year — have fallen in recent months and are expected to continue dropping as semiconductor shortages improve. The red-hot housing market is also starting to cool, as a run-up in mortgage rates discourages aspiring buyers from competing for the few homes available.

There are also limits to what the Fed can do to curb rising prices. Interest rate hikes cannot boost oil supply, bring more people into the labor market or end a war. Energy prices around the world have been rising for months, a reflection of the continuing ripple effects from Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine.

And though the Fed is in charge of controlling inflation, rising prices have soured Biden’s approval ratings for months and the White House has struggled to convince Americans that the economy is working for them.

At the same time inflation is so high, the labor market is unsustainably hot, with roughly two job openings for every person looking for work. The Fed’s goal is that higher interest rates can slow down hiring by making it more expensive for businesses to invest and hire.

In an interview with CNBC last week, Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard made clear the central bank is a long way from seeing progress.

“I’m going to be looking for a consistent string of data on both the strength of demand, the labor market coming into better balance, and of course, importantly, a string of decelerating inflation data to feel more confident,” she said.

We’re in the final countdown to British Home Secretary Priti Patel’s decision on the fate of Julian Assange, with the WikiLeaks founder’s extradition to the United States due to be approved or rejected by the end of the month. Joe Lauria has a new article out with Consortium News on the various pressures that Patel is being faced with from both sides of this history-making issue at this crucial time.

And I can’t stop thinking, as this situation comes to a boil, about how absurd it is that the US empire is working to set a precedent which essentially outlaws information-sharing that the US doesn’t like at the same time western news media are full of hand-wringing headlines about the dangerous threat of “disinformation”.

'Disinformation' Label Serves to Marginalize Crucial Ukraine Facts https://t.co/f9iQoHXzpT — FAIR (@FAIRmediawatch) May 18, 2022

Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) has an article out titled “‘Disinformation’ Label Serves to Marginalize Crucial Ukraine Facts” about the way the mass media have been spinning that label to mean not merely the knowing distribution of false information but also of information that is true but inconvenient to imperial narrative-weaving.

“In defense of the US narrative, corporate media have increasingly taken to branding realities inconvenient to US information goals as ‘disinformation’ spread by Russia or its proxies,” writes FAIR’s Luca Goldmansour.

Online platforms have been ramping up their censorship protocols under the banner of fighting disinformation and misinformation, and those escalations always align with narrative control agendas of the US-centralized empire. Just the other day we learned that Twitter has a new policy which expands its censorship practices to fight “misinformation” about wars and other crises, and the Ukraine war (surprise surprise) will be the first such situation about which it will be enforcing these new censorship policies.

Then there’s the recent controversy over the Department of Homeland Security’s “Disinformation Governance Board,” a mysterious institution ostensibly designed to protect the American people from wrongthink coming from Russia and elsewhere. The board’s operations (whatever they were) have been “paused” pending a review which will be led by Michael Chertoff, a virulent swamp monster and torture advocate. Its operations will likely be resumed in one form or another, probably under the leadership of someone with a low profile who doesn’t sing show tunes about disinformation.

And this all comes out after US officials straight up told the press that the Biden administration has been deliberately sowing disinformation to the public using the mainstream press in order to win an infowar against the Kremlin. They’ve literally just been circulating completely baseless stories about Russia and Ukraine, but nobody seems to be calling for the social media accounts of Biden administration officials to be banned.

Pressure Mounts on Patel Over Assange Decision https://t.co/QrSC9V4HSf — Consortium News (@Consortiumnews) May 23, 2022

You see so many discrepancies between what the oligarchic empire says and what it actually does regarding the issue of disinformation because the empire has no problem with disinformation. The empire that is built on propaganda and lies has no problem with propaganda and lies. It has a problem with the truth.

They’re not worried about disinformation, they’re worried about information. They’re worried about journalists using the unprecedented information-sharing power of the internet to reveal inconvenient facts about the largest and most murderous power structure on earth. They’re worried about people finding out that they’ve been lied to their entire lives about their world, their nation and their government. They’re worried about people using their newly connected minds to decide together that they don’t much like the status quo as it’s been laid out for them, and deciding to build a new one.

All the safeguards they’re setting up now to manipulate the flow of information online are not there to eliminate lies, they’re there to eliminate truth. These people have a vested interest in keeping things dark and confused, and we the ordinary people of the world have a vested interest in shining a big inconvenient spotlight on everything. The elite agenda to keep things endarkened is at direct odds with the people’s agenda to get things enlightened.

We are not being protected by a compassionate alliance of corporations and governments who only want us to know the truth, we are being manipulated and oppressed by an oligarchic empire that wants us to believe lies. That’s why they’re locking up Assange, that’s why they’re censoring the internet, that’s why they’re filling our minds with propaganda, and that’s why we can’t let them win.

5,https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61726733,"We've been reporting today on warnings of a potential outbreak of cholera in the occupied southern city of Mariupol.

Cholera can be a very serious illness. In the most severe cases, if left untreated, the disease can kill within hours.

It is caused by a bacterium called Vibrio cholerae and people tend to catch it by eating food or drinking water contaminated with the bug.

The spread of cholera is closely linked to poor sanitation facilities and unsafe drinking water where the bug can thrive and spread.

It is a disease that often adds to the suffering in humanitarian crises – when there is disruption of water and sanitation supplies and people shelter in crowded spaces, with extra pressure on water and sanitation systems.

It takes anywhere between 12 hours and five days for a person to show symptoms after ingesting the contaminated food and water.

Some people get watery diarrhoea and become severely dehydrated. This needs rapid treatment with fluids and antibiotics.

Others get mild to moderate symptoms and many with the disease do not have symptoms at all.

But even when symptom-free they can carry the bug in their faeces for up to 10 days after getting the infection - and it can then be shed back into the environment, with the potential to infect other people.

Cholera vaccines, in combination with improvements in water and sanitation, can help get cholera outbreaks under control.",1

Summary May PPI inflation year-on-year eases to 14-month low

May CPI year-on-year is in line with April's growth

BEIJING, June 10 (Reuters) - China's factory-gate inflation cooled to its slowest pace in 14 months in May, depressed by weak demand for steel, aluminium and other key industrial commodities due to tight COVID-19 curbs and bucking the global trend of rapidly accelerating prices.

The producer price index (PPI) rose 6.4% year-on-year, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Friday, after an 8.0% rise in April and in line with forecasts in a Reuters poll. It was the weakest reading since March 2021.

The consumer price index (CPI) gained 2.1% from a year earlier in May, in line with April's growth. In a Reuters poll, the CPI was expected to rise 2.2%.

The cooling inflation marks a sharp contrast to decades-high readings seen in other major economies and reflects the slump in demand due to China's strict COVID-19 controls, which has chilled factory and retail activity in recent months.

The modest price pressures also allow China's central bank to release more stimulus to prop up the economy even as monetary authorities in most other countries scramble to hose down inflation with aggressive interest rate hikes.

""Factory gate inflation will continue on its downward trajectory throughout the rest of the year,"" said Sheana Yue, China Economist at Capital Economics.

""Further policy rate cuts before long – the first of which might come as soon as next Wednesday,"" she noted, referring to the People's Bank of China's medium-term liquidity operations next week.

The world's second-largest economy has slowed significantly in recent months, hit by strict COVID-19 controls, disrupting supply chains and jolting production and consumption.

China's cabinet in late May announced a package of 33 measures covering fiscal, financial, investment and industrial policies to revive its economy. read more

Last month, widespread COVID-19 lockdowns shut factories and stores, choking purchases of metals-intensive products from cars to appliances.

Chinese auto sales grew in May from April but were still down 16% year-on-year, according to the Chinese Passenger Car Association.

The urban jobless rate rose to 6.1% in April, the highest since February 2020 and well above the government's target ceiling of 5.5%.

Non-food prices rose 2.1% from a year earlier, 0.1 percentage point slower than the previous month, affecting the CPI by about 1.68 percentage points, the NBS said in a separate statement.

On a month-on-month basis, CPI fell 0.2%, swinging from a 0.4% rise in April.

""The CPI inflation remained stable. The rising commodity prices were offset by weak service prices such as travel and entertainment,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, Chief Economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.

10,https://consortiumnews.com/2022/06/09/us-taxpayers-spent-billions-inflating-ceo-pay/,"Sarah Anderson says Biden has the power to crack down on executive excess by imposing new CEO pay and buyback restrictions on federal contractors.

By Sarah Anderson

Inequality.org

A tight labor market created a rare moment of leverage for low-wage workers last year. But Corporate America took no great leap forward on pay equity.

A new Institute for Policy Studies report, “Executive Excess 2022,” reveals how low-wage corporations have continued to pump up CEO pay during the pandemic while workers are struggling with rising costs.

The report zeroes in on compensation trends at the 300 publicly held U.S. corporations that reported the lowest median worker wages in 2020. At over a third of these firms — 106 in all — median worker pay either fell or failed to rise above the 4.7 percent average U.S. inflation rate in 2021.

By contrast, CEO pay at these same 300 low-wage firms soared 31 percent to an average of $10.6 million. This stunning increase drove the average gap between CEO and median worker pay at these companies to 670-to-1, up from 604-to-1 in 2020. At 49 of the 300 firms, pay ratios topped 1,000-to-1.

Amazon’s new CEO, Andy Jassy, raked in $212.7 million last year, making him the highest-paid CEO in our corporate low-wage sample. Jassy’s pay amounts to 6,474 times the $32,855 take-home of Amazon’s typical worker.

Of the 106 companies in our sample where median worker pay did not keep pace with inflation, 67 blew a combined total of $43.7 billion on stock buybacks. This financial maneuver inflates executive stock-based pay and drains capital from worker raises, R&D, and other productivity-boosting investments.

Corporate America’s perverse pay practices become even more disturbing when we consider another often overlooked reality: Ordinary Americans are supporting our inequitable corporate economic order through the hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded contracts and subsidies that flow every year to for-profit businesses.

Of the 300 companies in our sample, 40 percent received federal contracts totaling $37.2 billion over the past few years.

CEO pay apologists regularly argue that corporate leaders deserve their massive compensation packages because they bear enormous responsibilities and must take extraordinary risks.

This argument quickly falls apart when we compare CEOs at major contractors with the government officials ultimately responsible for their contracts.

The U.S. secretary of defense, for instance, manages the country’s largest workforce — more than 2 million employees — and makes life-and-death decisions on a daily basis. And yet the defense secretary and other Biden cabinet members make just $221,400 per year, less than three times as much as the $76,668 average federal employee annual pay.

By contrast, at the low-wage contractors we studied, CEO pay averaged $11.8 million and the average CEO-worker pay ratio sat at 571-to-1 in 2021.

Across the political spectrum, Americans are fed up with executive excess. One new poll shows that 87 percent see the growing gap between CEO and worker pay as a problem for the country.

President Joe Biden should not wait for Congress to tackle this problem. He already has the power to steer Corporate America in a more equitable direction through new standards for federal contractors, a set of companies that employ an estimated 25 percent of the U.S. private sector workforce.

Biden took an important step when he set a $15 per hour minimum wage for contractors. Now he should go further by making it hard for companies with huge CEO-worker pay gaps to land a lucrative deal with Uncle Sam.

Encouraging big companies to narrow their gaps is a matter of fairness — but not only a matter of fairness. It would also help ensure that taxpayer-funded contractors perform high-quality work, since study after study has shown that extreme pay disparities tend to undermine employee morale and boost turnover rates.

The president could also require contractors to remain neutral in union organizing campaigns, a move consistent with his recent show of support for workers fighting CEOs’ union-busting efforts at Amazon and Starbucks.

The Congressional Progressive Caucus called on Biden to take such actions in March.

The president could also prohibit CEOs from personally benefiting from stock bumps that occur when they make the decision to spend company resources on stock buybacks. This would help get the ball rolling on his proposal for legislation along these lines.

Executive actions, of course, can be repealed by future presidents. That’s one reason to continue pushing legislative solutions, such as raising the corporate tax rate on companies with large CEO-worker pay gaps.

Given the current congressional gridlock, though, the president should not hang back. The next White House occupant might want to undo these actions, but he or she would have a hard case to make. How do you persuade taxpayers they should be funding corporations that are fueling inequality?

It says FBI agents offered to contact an attorney for Navarro, but he wanted to use his phone to let a media outlet know he was likely to miss a scheduled TV interview.

When Navarro was offered a chance to call an attorney, according to the FBI agents, the defendant noted that he was preparing to proceed without one.

“SA Giardina asked, ‘do you have an attorney you’d like to call? What is the name of your attorney?’” the FBI report says.

According to the report, Navarro replied: “I’m supposed to be on live television tonight. I’d like to call the producer and tell him I’m not going to be there. Can I have my phone?”

“NAVARRO made statements to the effect that the arresting agents were ‘kind Nazis’ and ‘how could you live with yourselves?’” the report adds.

While some of Navarro’s allies have claimed he was pulled off an airplane, the report says he was intercepted by the FBI in a jetway at the airport as he prepared to board an American Airlines commuter flight bound for Nashville.

Navarro has also claimed that he was shackled after his arrest. The FBI report mentions handcuffs but no shackles, nor does it address any security practices he might have encountered after he was handed over to deputy U.S. marshals at the courthouse in Washington last Friday.

The Justice Department’s filing came a day after the department urged the judge in Navarro’s case, Amit Mehta, to quickly enter a “protective order” preventing Navarro from disseminating evidence provided to him by prosecutors. Navarro is due in court to be arraigned on the charges on June 17, but he has requested a 45-day delay — citing his effort to retain an attorney and to litigate a civil lawsuit against the department and the Jan. 6 select committee. The department said there was no legal basis to delay speedy-trial obligations to accommodate a civil lawsuit.

The department is urging Mehta to reject this request, noting that Navarro still has a week to obtain counsel and that his request for a delay would be disruptive to the case.

The FBI’s summary of Navarro’s arrest provides more details about the manner in which he was taken into custody. Navarro, who was accompanied by an unidentified individual, was in the jetway when he was taken into custody at 11:14 a.m., according to the agents. After he was led down the jetway steps, he was handcuffed and his wallet, cellphone and pen were taken and put in a manila envelope, the report indicates.

Navarro was taken to the FBI’s Washington Field Office for processing, including fingerprinting and a DNA sample, the report says.

After Navarro complained that his handcuffs were causing shoulder pain, they were replaced with a second set and loosened, which the agents said relieved Navarro’s discomfort. He initially rejected an offer of food, according to the summary, but asked for some at 12:08 p.m. and was given chocolate, nuts and dried fruit. He was later asked whether he wanted anything else to eat and declined, the report says.",1

By Richard Norton-Taylor

Declassified UK

J ournalists who receive some funding from foreign governments are at risk of committing offences under a bill that carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The risk also applies to individuals working for civil society organisations such as human rights groups.

It would be an offence to disclose leaked information that would prejudice the “safety or interests of” the U.K. What constituted such prejudice would be entirely a matter for ministers to decide and there would be no defence to argue that the publication was in the public interest.

The sweeping new threat to freedom of expression is contained in the National Security Bill, which is being championed by Home Secretary Priti Patel.

Although the government has claimed the measure is designed to prevent new types of spying, the bill is much broader, wider even than the much-criticised section 1 of the 1911 Official Secrets Act it would replace.

The 1911 Act refers to the obtaining or communication of information “calculated to be or might be or is intended to be directly or indirectly useful to an enemy” (emphasis added).

Also under the bill, ministers and spies would be given immunity from collusion in serious crimes overseas.

Life Imprisonment

The Freedom of Information (FoI) Campaign and Article 19, the global campaign for free expression, describe the bill as a major extension of the scope of offences in the 1911 Act.

They say: “A civil society organisation engaged in legitimate activities which has some funding for work on environmental, human rights, press freedom, asylum, aid or other issues from a friendly government could commit an offence under the bill.”

The prosecution would need to show only that such organisations had made use of leaked information “which they knew or should have known was restricted to avoid prejudicing the U.K. ’s safety or interests and that its use did prejudice the U.K.’s safety or interests.”

The organisations add:

“The decision on what constituted the U.K. ’s safety or interests would be the government’s and could not be challenged in court. If the government decided that the U.K. ’s energy situation required an immediate expansion of fracking or the building of coal fired or nuclear power plants, the use of leaked information which could undermine that policy could be a criminal offence under the bill. “The prosecution would only have to show that the information prejudiced the attainment of the government’s policy in the U.K. ’s interests and that the person who used the information received funding from a foreign government.”

On conviction, that person could face life imprisonment.

Overseas Funding

The FoI Campaign and Article 19 point out that the same would be true if an organisation with overseas government funding to confront the problems of asylum seekers used leaked information to oppose the U.K. government’s asylum policies.

The government could assert that these were necessary in the U.K.’s interests.

A journalist working for another government’s state broadcaster – including that of a friendly state – who reports on a leak of protected information which is held to be prejudicial to the U.K. ’s interests, would also commit an offence under the bill if they knew or ought to have known that the broadcast would prejudice the U.K. ’s safety or interests.

The fact that the journalist was paid by the funds of a foreign government department or agency and that the broadcasting organisation itself was financed by such funds would satisfy the foreign power condition.

They would also face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

Yet a journalist working for a U.K. news organisation responsible for an identical report based on the same leak could not commit this offence because the foreign power condition would not apply.

Richard Norton-Taylor is a British editor, journalist and playwright, and the doyen of British national security reporting. He wrote for The Guardian on defence and security matters and was the newspaper’s security editor for three decades.

17,https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-06-09-covid-vaccines-linked-to-athletes-deaths-increase.html,"(Natural News) A recent study has revealed the link of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) jabs to the shocking number of athlete deaths since the beginning of the vaccine rollout.

The investigation of official statistics done by the GoodSciencing.com team has found that the number of athletes who have died since the beginning of 2021 has risen exponentially to a massive 1,700 percent higher than the monthly average between 1966 and 2004.

Additionally, the current trend for 2022 so far shows this could increase to 4,120 percent if the increased number of deaths continues, with the number of deaths in March alone being three times higher than the previous annual average.

The 2021 total equates to 394 deaths, 14 times higher than the 1966 to 2004 annual average, whereas the January to April total is at 279 deaths, which is 9.96 times higher than the annual average from 1966-2004.

Between 1966 and 2004, the monthly average number of deaths equates to 2.35, however, between January 2021 and April 2022, the monthly average is 42. This is an increase of 1,696 percent.

“The increase was observed during the introduction of an experimental injection that was alleged to protect against COVID-19 disease, but instead caused untold damage to the immune system and cardiovascular problems,” the paper that was published on Global Research indicated.

The paper included 566 patients who received either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines and showed signs of cardiovascular damage following the second shot. The risk of heart attacks or other severe coronary problems more than doubled months after the vaccines were administered, based on changes in markers of inflammation and cell damage. (Related: Israeli study links COVID-19 vaccines to heart failure in young adults.)

Correlation of mRNA and adenoviral shots to deadly brain disease exposed

A French pre-print study on the coronavirus vaccines has likewise suggested a link between the vaccines and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a rare and fatal brain condition.

The research, which can be found on the Research Gate publication website, stated that Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines may have contributed to the emergence of a new type of sporadic CJD which is much more aggressive than the traditional form of the disease.

When the COVID-19 variant’s spike protein gene information was made into a vaccine as part of mRNA and adenoviral DNA vaccines, the prion region was also incorporated.

“After a patient takes Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccine, the mRNA is naturally incorporated into the person’s cells, which then use the mRNA instructions to produce a synthetic spike protein. This tricks the cells into believing that they have been infected so that they create an immunological memory against a component of the coronavirus,” the paper stated.

For AstraZeneca, which uses an adenoviral vector platform, the DNA of the spike protein is carried into the cell through an adenoviral vector and then into the nucleus, where all human DNA is stored. The DNA is then transcribed into mRNA and made into the spike protein.

Though major health organizations say genetic material from the vaccines isn’t incorporated into human DNA, mRNA studies conducted on human cells in labs proved that mRNA can be transcribed into DNA and then incorporated into the human genome.

It’s sad to say, but the biological process of translating mRNA information into proteins is not immune to mistakes. Thus, protein misfolding can occur.

CJD is caused by abnormalities in a protein in the brain called a prion. The naturally occurring proteins are usually harmless, but when they become misfolded, they cause nearby prions to also become misshapen, which could lead to the destruction of brain tissue and eventually death. Its symptoms can be similar to those of other dementia-like brain disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease.

The disease is incurable, as once one prion becomes infected, it continues to propagate to other prions. There is no current treatment capable of stopping its progress.

16,https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-06-09-gunman-attempts-murder-kavanaugh-roe-wade-abortion.html#,"(Natural News) A man brandishing a weapon has been taken into custody after he was allegedly caught trying to murder Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh over the high court’s leaked opinion on overturning Roe v. Wade.

The man had been making threats against Kavanaugh before appearing near the justice’s Maryland home, according to federal and local officials. (Related: Planned Parenthood supporters and other violent leftists have also pledged to murder the Supreme Court if abortion does not remain federally legal.)

The Washington Post says the man is from California and in his mid-20s. People familiar with the investigation claim that the man told police officers that he wanted to kill Kavanaugh, prompting them to stop and arrest him on a nearby street.

The man was allegedly carrying a gun, a knife and various burglary tools, according to people familiar with the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Two others, also anonymous, claim that the man was angry about the possible overturning of Roe v. Wade, as well as the recent spate of mass shootings.

Supreme Court spokeswoman Patricia McCabe issued a statement confirming the man’s arrest, which took place around 1:50 a.m. on June 8. Between the hours of 1:14 and 1:45 a.m., the man is said to have “c[o]me in from out of state with the intent to kill Kavanaugh.”

Why is Roe v. Wade suddenly being overturned at a time like this?

A spokeswoman for the FBI office in Maryland says the entity is “aware” of the arrest and is now “working with our law enforcement partners” to figure out what to do next, declining to comment any further.

A final decision about Roe v. Wade is expected to come possibly in early June. Enhanced security has been set up around the justices and the court itself, which now has a tall fence encircling the building – much like the wall that has been erected around the White House.

It is almost as if the corrupt federal government is blockading itself in anticipation of mass civil unrest, which will be targeted at federal officials over a variety of issues – think hyperinflation, economic collapse, food shortages, violence and more.

“Threats of violence and actual violence against the justices of course strike at the heart of our democracy,” stated Attorney General Merrick Garland when asked by the corporate-controlled media about acts and threats of violence against Supreme Court justices.

“And we will do everything we can to prevent them and to hold people who do them accountable.”

In his own statement, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, said he was briefed about the incident and decided to push for extra security measures, particularly around the justices’ homes.

“I call on leaders in both parties in Washington to strongly condemn these actions in no uncertain terms,” Hogan said. “It is vital to our constitutional system that the justices be able to carry out their duties without fear of violence against them and their families.”

Over at Natural News, one commenter questioned the timing of the Supreme Court’s supposedly leaked opinion on Roe v. Wade, particularly because it is directly coinciding with the collapse of Western civilization.

“This just seems to me like another deliberate trick of some kind,” this person wrote. “I mean, they’re being a little too peaceful about it at this point and this whole thing has me very suspicious.”

Another wrote that overturning Roe v. Wade will not even do anything, which makes the situation even more suspicious in terms of its true intent.

“It merely reverts to the states,” this person added about how abortion will still be legal most everywhere at the state level.

“The propaganda spinning immediately began as soon as the data began to show those who have been injected several times are not doing nearly as well as those who have refrained from taking the shots,” wrote Mac Slavo for SHTF Plan. “The mainstream media wants you to know that it isn’t the booster shots that are increasing the risk of getting COVID.” (Related: Patrick Gunnels tells Dr. Lee Merritt: Americans are the most gaslit people in the world when it comes to vaccines – Brighteon.TV.)

Alexander Tin, writing for CBS News, tried to claim that the rising hospitalization and death rates in American hospitals do not mean the booster vaccines are ineffective or that they somehow increase the risk of contracting COVID-19.

“Ongoing studies continue to provide strong evidence of additional protection offered by booster shots against infection, severe disease and death,” wrote Tin.

Instead, what CBS News is offering as a supposed justification for the sudden increase in COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths, is that the vaccines simply aren’t meant to prevent infections, merely lower the risk of hospitalization and death.

John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College, spoke to CBS News and admitted that the omicron variant, which mainstream media outlets fearmongered months ago, can still break through the antibody protections supposedly provided by COVID-19 vaccines.

But Moore added that fully vaccinated and boosted individuals who still contract breakthrough infections will only experience mild infections. He also went on to blame people for believing that they’re protected by the vaccine.

“So, one of the dynamics here is that people feel, after vaccination and boosting, that they’re more protected than they actually are, so they increase their risks,” he said. “That, I think, is the major driver of these statistics.”

Government still pushing for more vaccinations

Some of the data are too remarkable even for mainstream media outlets to deny. Information from the federal government shows that COVID-19 cases are on the uptick once again, but this time more of these new cases are coming from vaccinated and boosted Americans.

Furthermore, the data also shows that more and more fully vaccinated individuals are making up the number of people dying of COVID-19.

But despite media outlets admitting to this, government health officials still claim the best option for people is to get vaccinated and boosted.

“Almost no one in this country should be dying from COVID” if only they get vaccinated and take their boosters, claimed Dr. Robert Califf, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), during an appearance on CNN. “What we really should be worried about is getting the boosters that we need to stay up to date so with the new variants that we have, we don’t have the unnecessary deaths and hospitalizations.”

Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, also claimed that a surge is coming this fall and winter and the only way to prevent it is to get more Americans vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19.

“It’s really important that we try to get the half – or a little bit more than half – of Americans who have only received two doses to get that third dose,” he said, during a different appearance on CNN. “That may make a difference moving forward here, and it may particularly make a difference now that we’re coming into yet another wave of COVID-19.”
