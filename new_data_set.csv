We‚Äôre in the final countdown to British Home Secretary Priti Patel‚Äôs decision on the fate of Julian Assange, with the WikiLeaks founder‚Äôs extradition to the United States due to be approved or rejected by the end of the month. Joe Lauria has a new article out with Consortium News on the various pressures that Patel is being faced with from both sides of this history-making issue at this crucial time.

And I can‚Äôt stop thinking, as this situation comes to a boil, about how absurd it is that the US empire is working to set a precedent which essentially outlaws information-sharing that the US doesn‚Äôt like at the same time western news media are full of hand-wringing headlines about the dangerous threat of ‚Äúdisinformation‚Äù.

'Disinformation' Label Serves to Marginalize Crucial Ukraine Facts https://t.co/f9iQoHXzpT ‚Äî FAIR (@FAIRmediawatch) May 18, 2022

Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) has an article out titled ‚Äú‚ÄòDisinformation‚Äô Label Serves to Marginalize Crucial Ukraine Facts‚Äù about the way the mass media have been spinning that label to mean not merely the knowing distribution of false information but also of information that is true but inconvenient to imperial narrative-weaving.

‚ÄúIn defense of the US narrative, corporate media have increasingly taken to branding realities inconvenient to US information goals as ‚Äòdisinformation‚Äô spread by Russia or its proxies,‚Äù writes FAIR‚Äôs Luca Goldmansour.

Online platforms have been ramping up their censorship protocols under the banner of fighting disinformation and misinformation, and those escalations always align with narrative control agendas of the US-centralized empire. Just the other day we learned that Twitter has a new policy which expands its censorship practices to fight ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù about wars and other crises, and the Ukraine war (surprise surprise) will be the first such situation about which it will be enforcing these new censorship policies.

Then there‚Äôs the recent controversy over the Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs ‚ÄúDisinformation Governance Board,‚Äù a mysterious institution ostensibly designed to protect the American people from wrongthink coming from Russia and elsewhere. The board‚Äôs operations (whatever they were) have been ‚Äúpaused‚Äù pending a review which will be led by Michael Chertoff, a virulent swamp monster and torture advocate. Its operations will likely be resumed in one form or another, probably under the leadership of someone with a low profile who doesn‚Äôt sing show tunes about disinformation.

And this all comes out after US officials straight up told the press that the Biden administration has been deliberately sowing disinformation to the public using the mainstream press in order to win an infowar against the Kremlin. They‚Äôve literally just been circulating completely baseless stories about Russia and Ukraine, but nobody seems to be calling for the social media accounts of Biden administration officials to be banned.

Pressure Mounts on Patel Over Assange Decision https://t.co/QrSC9V4HSf ‚Äî Consortium News (@Consortiumnews) May 23, 2022

You see so many discrepancies between what the oligarchic empire says and what it actually does regarding the issue of disinformation because the empire has no problem with disinformation. The empire that is built on propaganda and lies has no problem with propaganda and lies. It has a problem with the truth.

They‚Äôre not worried about disinformation, they‚Äôre worried about information. They‚Äôre worried about journalists using the unprecedented information-sharing power of the internet to reveal inconvenient facts about the largest and most murderous power structure on earth. They‚Äôre worried about people finding out that they‚Äôve been lied to their entire lives about their world, their nation and their government. They‚Äôre worried about people using their newly connected minds to decide together that they don‚Äôt much like the status quo as it‚Äôs been laid out for them, and deciding to build a new one.

All the safeguards they‚Äôre setting up now to manipulate the flow of information online are not there to eliminate lies, they‚Äôre there to eliminate truth. These people have a vested interest in keeping things dark and confused, and we the ordinary people of the world have a vested interest in shining a big inconvenient spotlight on everything. The elite agenda to keep things endarkened is at direct odds with the people‚Äôs agenda to get things enlightened.

We are not being protected by a compassionate alliance of corporations and governments who only want us to know the truth, we are being manipulated and oppressed by an oligarchic empire that wants us to believe lies. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre locking up Assange, that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre censoring the internet, that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre filling our minds with propaganda, and that‚Äôs why we can‚Äôt let them win.

Klarna gives customers the option of when to pay for an item ‚Äî they can pay upfront, pay in installments or delay payment for a certain period of time. Critics say this enables people to buy things they might not necessarily be able to afford, although Klarna says it runs affordability checks to ensure that consumers can pay them back.

In an interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Friday, the Swedish entrepreneur said BNPL is ""superior"" to the credit card model, claiming that the average Klarna user has an outstanding balance of $50, whereas the average credit card user has an outstanding balance of $5,000.

Siemiatkowski went on to say his business is ""extremely recession-proof"" compared with traditional credit card firms. However, the fintech reported a loss of $748 million last year and last month announced that it was laying off around 10% of its 6,500 staff as part of an effort to cut costs.

On top of that, Klarna will soon be competing with Apple in the BNPL sector after the iPhone maker announced this week that it plans to enter the market with a new product called Apple Pay Later.

That puts BNPL players like PayPal, Affirm and Klarna in an awkward spot. The fear is that Apple, a $2 trillion company and the world's second-largest smartphone manufacturer, could draw clients away from such services. Shares of Affirm have sunk 17% so far this week on the news.

""I think it's a final, massive embracement of what to me is a much healthier form of credit,"" Siemiatkowski said of Apple's entry into the market.",1

by Ramin Mazaheri for the Saker blog

‚ÄúThe Radicals (Western Liberal Democratic reformists) are the democratic party of French imperialism ‚Äì any other definition is a lie.‚Äù ‚Äì Trotsky

It is too facile to refute the Western Mainstream media‚Äôs ‚Äúmanufactured consent‚Äù, to use Noam Chomsky‚Äôs famous phrase, which gave overwhelming support to the police brutality and legal repression of the Yellow Vests. They did this by a tactic which has become common in the post-Lisbon Treaty West: calling them a ‚Äúbasket of deplorables‚Äù, racists, xenophobes, fascists, homophobes, etc., despite all the abundant evidence to the contrary.

(This is the fourteenth chapter in a new book, France‚Äôs Yellow Vests: Western Repression of the West‚Äôs Best Values. Please click here for the article which announces this book and explains its goals.)

On October 16, 2022, the Yellow Vests were finally allowed to start what they termed ‚ÄúSeason 2‚Äù: normal political activity ‚Äì which had been banned by the coronavirus lockdowns starting in March 2020 ‚Äì was allowed to be resumed. The pause was welcomed by no global leader more heartily than the embattled Emmanuel Macron. The banner given pride of place to lead the Paris demonstration was of a Muslim woman wearing a hijab and a medical mask.

There had been no conversion during the lockdowns ‚Äì the Yellow Vests have always been anti-racist.

In July 2020 they had marched to remember the 3rd anniversary of Adama Traore, a young Muslim Black man infamously killed while in police custody.

Yellow Vest: ‚ÄúIf you look around here you see people of all colours and religions. For me it goes beyond questions of origin ‚Äì it‚Äôs really a question of social justice, regardless of someone‚Äôs ethnicity or religion.‚Äù

(Note: this book intersperses over 100 quotations taken from actual, marching Yellow Vests which were originally published in news reports on PressTV.)

In February 2020 they had marched against anti-Semitism. At a previous Yellow Vest march far-right thinker Alain Finkielkraut was called a ‚Äúdirty Zionist‚Äù and was told he was not welcome at Yellow Vest demonstrations. This allowed for an immediate media slander campaign which, shamefully, culminated in Emmanuel Macron‚Äôs criminalisation of anti-Zionism (opposition to the colonialist political project to create Israel) by falsely conflating it with anti-Semitism (opposition to Jews and Judaism). The irony was that just three months earlier Macron had caused international shock by publicly praising the anti-Semitic leader of Nazi-collaborating Vichy France, Philippe P√©tain. In 2014 France had became the first country ever to ban pro-Palestinian marches. France has the world‚Äôs third-largest Jewish population, and even though French Muslims outnumber them around 10 to 1 there is no comparison between the two political and cultural influence of the two groups.

Yellow Vest: ‚ÄúThe French media wants to make people believe that Yellow Vests are anti-Semitic because they insulted Alain Finkielkraut, but the vast majority of Yellow Vests are in favor of solidarity and against any form of racism. Yellow Vests are here tonight to say we are against anti-Semitism.‚Äù

Not that the French mainstream media cares about French Muslims, but many French commentators accused the Yellow Vests of being Islamophobic because they didn‚Äôt have enough Muslims marching with them, they insisted. It was a false claim. The problem is that these commentators were looking for Muslim caricatures, not French Muslims. They wanted to see burqas, beards, African clothing and signs in Arabic ‚Äì but these types of Muslims are not representative of the average Muslim in France. The same accusation against Muslims during the ‚ÄúJe suis Charlie‚Äù march was also made, but many Muslims protested then as well. Anyway, Muslims are a small minority in France, relatively equal to the number of those with red hair.

The most important reason why Muslims may have hesitated from marching with the Yellow Vests is because they would have certainly been the first victims of police brutality. A group of dark-skinned people with Yellow Vests standing together would be like waving a red flag at the idiotic bulls and bullies who are French CRS riot cops (Compagnies r√©publicaines de s√©curit√© ‚Äì Republican Security Companies). Thus, an absolutely vital concept which the Yellow Vests proved to France is that police brutality is not just against the Adama Traores of France, but that police brutality is rooted in class oppression above all. The Yellow Vests proved ‚Äì emphatically ‚Äì what non-Whites (and the United Nations, and countless NGOs, and countless protesters) had said for years: French police brutality is among the worst in the world.

Yellow Vest: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt suffer from police or state repression because I am White and because I don‚Äôt live in a poor area, but because I joined the Yellow Vests demonstrations I have now suffered from police violence. This issue (of police violence) concerns everyone.‚Äù

When Emmanuel Macron put the idea of immigration at the centre of his Great National Debate ‚Äì even though it figured nowhere among the demands of the Yellow Vests ‚Äì the goal was twofold: the classic Liberalist/fascist obsession with identity politics, and also to maintain the false link between xenophobia and the Yellow Vests, i.e. guilt by association. Liberalist elite now insist that they are supreme not because of royal blood, but because of their incredibly decent blood ‚Äì thus, the poor must portrayed as embittered people with closed minds who want to close off their communities.

Yellow Vest: ‚ÄúFrom the beginning of the movement they have tried to slander us as racists, xenophobes and crazy people, and now they are trying to accuse of being anti-Semitic. All around the country there were marches this week against anti-Semitism, but the media only covered Paris and ignored the anti-racism marches in small towns.‚Äù

I could go on and on with actual proofs and quotes of the anti-xenophobia efforts of the Yellow Vests, because I was there so often, but this discussion is entirely false to begin with.

At the beginning the Yellow Vests were as heterogenous as France itself, so of course it went across the entire spectrum, from the far-left to the far-right. The only class which refused to join were the bourgeois bloc ‚Äì Macronistas and blinkered Europhiles. The two previous chapters fully described the characteristics and composition of the Yellow Vests, revealing no allegiance, ideological ties or even Facebook chatter which inclines to the far-right. Academics found that the Yellow Vest demands resembled the political party France Insoumise (Unsubmissive France Party). This is a political party which is invariably labelled as ‚Äúfar-left‚Äù and ‚Äúextreme left‚Äù in the mainstream media (although I rank them as simply ‚Äúleft‚Äù), and which is led by Jean-Luc Melenchon, who to the mainstream media is invariably a ‚Äúfar-left firebrand‚Äù. How can this be true and yet the Yellow Vests are also right-wing xenophobes? They are leftist in economic and political ideology yet far-right racists in cultural matters? What an absurdity and falsehood!

It is an outright lie, but the dearth of reporting on the Yellow Vests means that most people are operating on total ignorance regarding the Yellow Vests, and on the realities of Western Liberal Democracy in general.

What‚Äôs more necessary to ask is: why are the slander campaigns necessary?

Firstly, it must noted that the slander of the Yellow Vests as racist xenophobes was more often seen in the Anglosphere than in France, due to the latter‚Äôs decreased obsession with race/tribalism. Within France the most common slander was actually that they were just stupid hooligans or wreckers (casseurs). Identity politics ‚Äì and the ability to lay a (mostly race-based) guilt-trip on the White working poor ‚Äì simply doesn‚Äôt work as well in France as in the Anglosphere, thankfully, but that‚Äôs not to say it makes no inroads at all. This greater resilience is due to France‚Äôs history of 1789- and socialist-inspired egalitarianism, which necessarily produces an undoubtedly more intelligent political culture overall than in the English-speaking world.

Both types of calumny were used for the same reasons: to distract from the failures of Liberalism, and of the pan-European project, to manufacture support for Western Liberal Democracy‚Äôs 1%-centred political agenda, and for its false electoral tactics that serve as a safety valve for actual political progress.

The Yellow Vests sought to put the issues of the working poor and of the working class back at the front of the media and political agenda. Thus, their only ‚Äúxenophobic‚Äù crime was this: fact-based bias against the elite minority.

To use nonsensical Western terms: it is ‚Äòxenophobia‚Äô to question the rule of the 1%

Thus a primary conclusion we must draw from the Yellow Vest experience is that Western Liberal Democracy will portray anyone who tries to put economic issues on the agenda as being fascistic.

Just as crucially, they will emphasise only the xenophobia of 1930s fascism while totally omitting the anti-Liberalist, anti-Bankocracy aspects of 1930s fascism.

The point of chapters 7 and 8, discussing the 1930s, was to make it clear that Western politics has never reconciled (has never wanted to reconcile) with the arrival, meaning and legacy of fascism. Those groups came to power because they publicly and correctly condemned the oligarchic and autocratic nature of Western Liberal Democracy, which was gleaned from their acceptance of Marxist-inspired analyses of 19th century politics and economics. However, they irrevocably broke with Marxism by replacing the international brotherhood of the class struggle with a self-worshipping and competitive xenophobia. Precisely because fascists (like so many socialists) assumed that Western Liberal Democracy had been irrevocably discredited by the modern industrial horrors of imperialism (such as those of the French Third Republic), by World War I, by the Great Depression etc., they concentrated their efforts on crushing socialism in the USSR ‚Äì Western Liberal Democracy was already smashed, they assumed. When they failed the fascists were eagerly subsumed by Western Liberal Democracies because they always, of course, sought to smash socialism, anti-imperialism and the working class worldwide in order to maintain the ‚Äúbourgeois‚Äù power of only-recently ousted royals, high finance, industrialists and their ‚Äútalented tenth‚Äù of sycophants. A major reason why Westerners cannot comprehend their own contemporary and 20th century politics is because they fail to remember that Western Liberal Democracy was broadly considered the most ‚Äúevil‚Äù prior to World War II, and they are now kept in the historical and ideological dark regarding Western Liberal Democracy‚Äôs subsuming of fascism via the most false propaganda regarding it‚Äôs 1%-focused ideology. This brief but accurate retelling of 20th century Western historical development helps us understand why Western politics in the 2020s is so very similar to the 1930s ‚Äì we are constantly being warned of a ‚Äúfascist‚Äù threat which is not ‚Äúfascist‚Äù.

The enormous contemporary difference is that ‚Äì thanks to the socialist-led anti-segregation, anti-apartheid and anti-racism movements, as well as the much maligned lens of ‚Äúpolitical correctness‚Äù ‚Äì racism and xenophobia has been decreased to the point where pogroms are no longer possible in the West (and in a West now often reconstituted thanks to unprecedented immigration). There will be no mass murder of Muslims in France, to give one example ‚Äì too many non-Muslims would come to their aid. Morality has changed, just as morality changed in the 19th century to ban slavery. Xenophobia as a political ideology has lost in the heart of the average Western person ‚Äì it is only the Western Liberal Democratic 1% which keeps xenophobia going.

It is kept going by the bourgeois bloc-elite because a hysterical fear-mongering against a ‚Äúfascism‚Äù which is not even fascism ‚Äì which carries no threat of Germanic genocides but all the corporate-government alliance which fascism promoted economically (as opposed to the worker empowerment and egalitarianism of Socialist Democracy) ‚Äì has proven to be an effective electoral and capitalistic culture tactic to prevent the century-long delayed revolution against Western Liberal Democracy.

The Yellow Vests implicitly call for just such a revolution ‚Äì thus they had to be deemed ‚Äúfascist‚Äù: they pointed out the failures of Western Liberal Democracy, which this book has proven has existed since its very inception in 1848, and back to its 1688 roots in oligarchic English parliamentarianism.

The electoral tactic is a repeat of the failed safety valve in 1936 France ‚Äì the ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Front‚Äù, an alliance of all parties centre and left (and now green, too) in order to keep the scourge of fascism at bay. In the 21st century this new coalition is twice as retarding of social progress than the one in the 1930s because it is not even half as leftist ‚Äì Chapter 9 was based around proving how the French leftist elites have been swayed by Liberalism and have given up actual leftism.

I call this new ideology ‚ÄúPFAXIsm‚Äù, and it is what Western fake-leftists have incessantly called for since 2016 (which is when the travesty of the 2008 Financial Crisis and the Great Recession began to be registered in the political ideologies and votes of many Westerners, such as with Brexit and the election of Donald Trump): a ‚ÄúPopular Front for Anti-Xenophobic Imperialism‚Äù. It is pronounced very similar to ‚Äúfascism‚Äù for an obvious reason.

This acronym describes the paradox of someone marching against xenophobia, but doing so upon the corpses perpetually caused by capitalism-imperialism. By not only rejecting Socialist Democracy but even much of mere Social Democracy modern Western politics sees their ‚Äúrighteous‚Äù elite marching against xenophobia while also marching their lower classes off to distant capitalist-imperialist war. The proofs of this are too legion to mention. PFAXism is the result of neutering leftism of any demand for redistributing political power and wealth while insisting that non-Whites and non-heterosexuals get an (allegedly) equal chance to climb up to the Liberalist 1% elite.

This is not progressive politics.

The fact that one can be the most rabid ‚Äúneoliberal‚Äù while being also anti-xenophobic shows that anti-xenophobia cannot provide the foundation of a leftist, progressive political doctrine.

The most false claim by PFAXists is that they are ‚Äútolerant and inclusive‚Äù of minorities, but they are only tolerant of minorities who share their Liberalist views. Thus, they are not tolerant at all ‚Äì they are actually fighting class warfare, and their class is that of the elite.

Above all, PFAXism is being pushed precisely because of Western Liberal Democracy‚Äôs struggle to keep from being completely fascistic: The only legacy Western Liberal Democracy wants to keep from socialism is anti-xenophobia, but they cannot because xenophobia is an inescapable component of imperialist capitalism, while elitism is an inescapable component of Western Liberal Democracy

The undemocratic installation of the pan-European project, the brutality against the Yellow Vests and the rollback of Social Democracy prove the accuracy of these contemporary conclusions.

Thus a good definition of Western ‚Äúfake-leftism‚Äù during the Yellow Vest era was to being flailing wildly, ignorantly and falsely about fake fascism (and Russian interference for any anti-‚Äúneoliberal‚Äù development) in order to distract from the obvious errors, inequalities and autocracies of Western Liberal Democracy.

A ‚Äúprogressive politics‚Äù which must rely on wilfully ignoring the crimes of Western Liberal Democracy is by definition not progressive, and any other definition is a lie.

The Yellow Vests smashed PFAXIsm just as they re-discredited Western Liberal Democracy

Just as modern Western Liberal Democracy cannot or will not define fascism properly, they also cannot identify what true Western leftism is even while watching it getting beat up by cops every Saturday. Just as Edmund Burke and the Whigs falsely insisted that they were still the true progressives in 1789 ‚Äì despite being Rights of Man-denying sycophants to pro-monarchy oligarchs ‚Äì so do modern Western fake-leftists falsely insist the same, totally behind the times.

This why what Trotsky wrote about France in the 1930s remains a valid electoral analysis today, and even across the West.

‚ÄúThe whole meaning of the present political situation resides in the fact that the despairing petty bourgeoisie (the small businessman class) is beginning to break from the yoke of parliamentary discipline and from the tutelage of the conservative ‚ÄòRadical‚Äô (i.e. Liberal Reformist) clique, which has always fooled the people and which has now definitely betrayed it. To join in this situation with the Radicals (Reformists) means to condemn oneself to the scorn of the masses and to push the petty bourgeoisie into the embrace of fascism as its sole saviour. The working class party must occupy itself not with a hopeless effort to save the party of the bankrupts. It must, on the contrary, with all its strength, accelerate the process of liberation of the masses from Radical (Reformist) influence.‚Äù (emphasis mine)

The entire problem of contemporary Western politics ‚Äì with its schizophrenic inability to accurately define ‚Äúleft‚Äù, ‚Äúright‚Äù, ‚Äúfascism‚Äù, ‚ÄúNazi‚Äù, ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù, etc. ‚Äì has just been summarised: Not understanding that any party in favor of Western Liberal Democracy is a party of the bankrupts.

Trotsky, socialists, fascists and even the average European knew this in the 1930s but the message has been obscured and forgotten. This concept also provides the best explanation for the domestic popularity of the Yellow Vests in France: they refused to associate with any of the ‚Äúparty of the bankrupts‚Äù of the re-discredited French political establishment.

Western Liberal Democracy has waged propaganda wars that it was redeemed by winning World War II. Even though the socialist USSR and China paid the overwhelming costs for victory, somehow the war provided redemption for the Western Liberal Democratic horrors of industrial imperialism, World War I and the Great Depression. It‚Äôs preposterous propaganda, of course. The return of Liberalism in the mid-1970s to roll back mere Social Democracy, to impose the undemocratic pan-European project and the repression of the Yellow Vests has emphatically reminded that Western Liberal Democracy remains the party of the bankrupts.

Must we have a World War III, a 2nd Great Depression and new era of horrific neo-imperialism to remind us of this inevitable conclusion?!

The Yellow Vests are so vital because they refused to save the party of the bankrupts, which meant they rendered totally impotent the mystifying absurdities and the obscuration of the class struggle inherent in PFAXist ideas. Just as one can retort, ‚Äúthe Yellow Vests‚Äù to a Western Liberal Democrat who claims the moral high ground over other political ideologies, one can also retort ‚Äúthe Yellow Vests‚Äù to Westerners who claim all ‚Äúpopulist‚Äù movements are far-right xenophobes. These are two major, major achievements.

The Trump movement in the US could never have achieved that: Trump is a completely fascist leader. He is akin to Adolf Hitler in that Hitler also rejected typical imperialism ‚Äì his invasions were to gather all the Germanic peoples into one Germanic-only superstate. Hitler famously refused to be bought off by Paris and London with their offers of some of their non-White colonies ‚Äì he wanted to annex only Germanic areas. Trump was the least belligerent American president since World War II, and his diplomatic overtures to North Korea and Russia (strangled in the cradle by Russiagate ‚Äì the disproven allegations of Trump‚Äôs ties to the Kremlin) sent the Western Liberal Democratic elite into an unprecedented fury. Trump generated enormous global popularity mainly due to his rejection of the globalist wing of Western Liberal Democracy and foreign war, but his progressive political bonafides are scant because, again, fascism is only slightly better than Western Liberal Democracy. The US ultimately has zero interest in political reforms ‚Äì they are the modern day Whigs in their deluded insistence that they are the world‚Äôs most truly progressive nation.

The Leave movement in Brexit was a typically British affair in its insularity and it in its latently conservative ‚Äì and not ardently progressive ‚Äì motivations. Looking over at a continent in economic and political chaos in 2016, and having a press honest enough to admit the undemocratic basis of the pan-European project (though not being in the euro gave them the most necessary latitude), did indeed produce a progressive and self-preserving result for the UK. It did inspire calls for other nations to leave the EU, which is also progressive. However, simply ‚Äú-exiting‚Äù is not enough: it provides no example for countries not in Europe, for example. This was merely a one-issue movement, after all.

It‚Äôs vital to recall that ‚ÄúAmerican fascism‚Äù and ‚ÄúEnglish oligarchy‚Äù was never discredited as was fascism on the Continent ‚Äì they helped win World War II, were never conquered even partially and never fully colluded. Only the intensely racist parts in the US were eventually discredited (thus the end of Jim Crow), as were the intensely autocratic/elitist/pro-monarchy parts of the UK (thus the long, long-delayed acceptance of republicanism within the British Commonwealth, which was established by the London Declaration of 1949, marking the formal beginning of the modern Commonwealth).

But this also means that for decades ‚Äì quite significantly ‚Äì there has never been honest discussion about fascism in the US and UK. This is evidenced by the fact that, unlike on the Continent, for decades there was no ‚Äúanti-fascist‚Äù political fight in either Anglophone imperialist nation because they falsely assume that Western Liberal Democracy is inherently anti-fascist. Indeed, ‚Äúfascism‚Äù only became a domestic problem in these two countries in 2016! In a world which has become more and more Anglophone and dominated by Anglophone culture their 1% neo-aristocratic/bourgeois had never been stopped until 2016.

However, the world understands politics well enough to understand that both nations are totally incapable of leading a truly progressive and internationalist movement, no matter how much these two nations falsely believe their own propaganda.

The Yellow Vests, however, were not just a one-issue social movement but a social revolt. The left-wing, transnational basis of this revolt became immediately apparent ‚Äì they were emulated in over two dozen countries. The sale of Yellow Vests had to be banned in Egypt, where the West shamefully helped topple the progressive 2011 Revolution because it progressively demanded a role for Islam in politics.

Had the Yellow Vests not come along who or what would have provided such an easy, accurate retort to the Western Liberal Democratic and PFAXIst claim that all ‚Äúpopulist‚Äù movements are far-right xenophobes?

The Yellow Vests are primarily an economic movement: taxes, lack of public services, high cost of products of premier necessity ‚Äì this is the basis of the protest. Contrarily, there is no economic basis of PFAXIsm, thus they are not compatible with the Yellow Vests. PFAXIsm does not care about the incapacity of Western Liberal Democracy to care about the economic concerns of the working poor and middle classes.

The political foundation of the Yellow Vests is the anti-democratic autocracy which has been employed since 2009. Many Yellow Vests do not yet comprehend that Western Liberal Democracy has never cared about the economic and democratic concerns of the working poor and middle classes ‚Äì this book aims to rectify their misperceptions of history.

(For the record: in the quote of Trotsky above I replaced the word ‚ÄúRadical‚Äù with ‚ÄúReformist‚Äù because the Radical Party was anti-socialist, anti-communist and allied with the bourgeois to the hilt. Their name stems from the era when even mere Western Liberal Democracy and republicanism were still considered to be radical. The party was founded in 1901 ‚Äì it‚Äôs the oldest active political party in France today, and now on the right-wing ‚Äì back when when Germanic emperors and kings still ruled autocratically, and thus Liberalist rights for those outside of the aristocratic oligarchy were still ‚Äúradical‚Äù. After only a few years, and amid the rise of socialism, they were quickly re-placed further and further on the right of the political spectrum. Their slogan was ‚ÄúNeither reaction nor revolution!‚Äù Thus, what could be a better term than mere, inadequate ‚ÄúReformist‚Äù?)

What is the political choice for Yellow Vests and their supporters in a PFAXIst society?

Because of the dominance of PFAXIsm, which attempts to hide how Western Liberal Democracy has subsumed much of fascism, Trotsky‚Äôs concern in 1936 that the French would be pushed ‚Äúinto the embrace of fascism as its sole saviour‚Äù is no longer applicable.

Western Liberal Democracy has joined with fascism ‚Äì from ex-Nazis in Western German to ‚Äú3rd-generation Nazis‚Äù in Ukraine ‚Äì and this is something which would have been difficult for Trotsky to accurately predict. It would have been difficult in large part because he conflated ‚ÄúBonapartism‚Äù with ‚ÄúLiberalism‚Äù, even though the two are different and were opposed to each other: the former having genuine grassroots, and thus democratic, support and the latter never really having it.

No politician in France is offering even the semi-socialist analysis offered by fascism anymore: Marine Le Pen‚Äôs neo-National Socialism in 2017 was replaced in the 2022 election campaign with a reversion to ‚Äúneoliberalism‚Äù, acceptance of high finance and dead-end reformism for the pan-European project.

PFAXIsm thus can reign forever in the West: Citizens can forever tune in to find scapegoating (In France: of Muslims) or they can find a scapegoating of the scapegoaters, but they will never find what the Yellow Vests are talking about: redistribution of economic and political power, which would be the only way to end the inequalities the scapegoaters of scapegoaters claim to care about. There is no way out if one foolishly accepts the greatly similar tenets of PFAXIsm, fascism or Western Liberal Democracy.

All experiences of Popular Fronts ‚Äì an alliance with elements of the ruling class ‚Äì have ended in shameful defeat, and 2022 will be no different in France. The Nouvelle Union Populaire √©cologique et sociale (NUPES ‚Äì the New People‚Äôs Ecologic and Social Union) gathered together the communists, socialists, greens, Melenchon‚Äôs leftist France Insoumise and the smaller leftist parties (but not the Trotskyists). The goal is to break Macron‚Äôs absolute control over Parliament and to deny the far-right a greater share. The latter was immediately, and foolishly, deemed the more important goal: on the night of his presidential first round loss Melenchon roared ‚Äúnot one vote‚Äù for Le Pen in the second round, and immediately began a foolish and certain-to-fail campaign to be Macron‚Äôs prime minister. Polls show Macron‚Äôs En Marche party winning 55% of the National Assembly this month ‚Äì that‚Äôs seemingly a slight absolute majority, but here‚Äôs the kicker: the conservatives (which En Marche should be truly classed with) are polling at 20%, and thus Liberalist deforms will roll over a NUPES alliance which is polling to win just 20% of parliament.

In 2022 NUPES will prove to be much like 1936. As Trotsky wrote: ‚Äúa classic definition of the People‚Äôs Front: A safety valve for the mass movement.‚Äù

NUPES will end in failure, disappointment and discredit, as popular fronts ‚Äì an alliance with elements of the ruling class ‚Äì always do. Thus Chapter 7 ‚Äì Where the West is stuck: The fascism of the 1930s and the ‚Äòfascism‚Äô of the 2020s ‚Äì was both a prescient prediction of the formation of NUPES and an explanation of its certain failure. Hope you‚Äôre glad you read that chapter ‚Äì when the final legislative results are announced on June 19 you‚Äôll be ready!

But it is undoubtedly due to the discrediting example of the Yellow Vests that France‚Äôs left was forced to do something different, finally. This was the first leftist coalition since the Socialist Party-dominated ‚ÄúPlural Left‚Äù, which won control over Parliament in 1997. However, all the ‚Äúparty of the bankrupts‚Äù could offer and achieve was a bankrupt strategy and bankrupt results, again. The upcoming chapter on the unions will point out how the discrediting example of the Yellow Vests forced the unions to actually do something ‚Äì launch a general strike ‚Äì but with a similarly wilfully bankrupt strategy and results.

Trotsky promoted something different than the Popular Front: the united front, which is mobilisation of the working class independent of the ruling class and its political parties. This is essentially what the Yellow Vests are, obviously. Indeed, it‚Äôs so telling that today‚Äôs Trotskyists are so lost and discredited that they cannot or will not ally with the Yellow Vests.

Trotsky speculated what a good united front would actually aim to do:

‚ÄúThe united front does not renounce parliamentary struggle but it utilises parliament above all to unmask is impotence, and to explain to the people that the present government has an extra-parliamentary base, and that it can be overthrown only by a powerful mass movement.‚Äù

Only a Yellow Vest party would actually do this in French parliament, not any of the NUPES alliance. The entire history of Western Liberal Democracy is to hide or paper over its oligarchy, which is to say that ‚Äúextra-parliamentary base‚Äù which undemocratically controls policy.

The failure of France‚Äôs ‚Äúleftist‚Äù Popular Front in the late 1930s proved that Western Liberal Democracy would never cooperate with any kind of leftism, even fake-leftism. Thus, fascism came to power because the average European realised that Western Liberal Democracy is a perpetual dead-end. Fascism‚Äôs arrival was only by (foreign-aided) force in Spain ‚Äì everywhere else it was due to popular acceptance that Liberalism was nothing but autocratic and plutocratic oligarchy.

Trotsky wrote of France: ‚ÄúThe policy of coalition with the bourgeoisie must be paid for by the proletariat with years of new torments and sacrifices, if not by decades of fascist terror.‚Äù

What Trotsky could not have foreseen is the crucial reality I keep stressing: Western Liberal Democracy has subsumed fascism, thus decades of fascist terror by France and the West has been the global reality long after the 1930s. Thus 2027 cannot be a repeat of 1940 even if Marine Le Pen wins, as many expect, because her ‚Äúfascism‚Äù is not fascism at all. Human history is not uselessly cyclical but linear: as much as PFAXIsm wants to insist otherwise, post-2016 ‚Äúfascism‚Äù is simply not the same as 1930s fascism.

‚ÄúOn the other hand, if we continue to mark time, the pre-revolutionary situation will inevitably be changed into one of counterrevolution, and will bring on the victory of fascism, ‚Äù wrote Trotsky, correctly. However, almost a century later the analysis must incorporate the political changes since then: if the French merely tread water from the Yellow Vests‚Äô creation of a pre-revolutionary situation then fascism will continue its long victory streak in the West.

In between the first and second rounds of the 2017 election I promoted Macron as the worse choice between him and Le Pen. I was proven totally right that Macron was not some friend of anti-racism/pro-Muslim movements. I was also proven totally right that Macron was as authoritarian as a fascist ‚Äì simply look at the Yellow Vests, the normalisation of the state of emergency and his autocratic governing methods.

In between the first and second rounds of the 2022 election I also promoted a vote of Le Pen over Macron. Once again it was the only progressive gain which could have been made: Giving Le Pen power would have shown that Western Liberal Democracy is elitist, fascist and awful. Donald Trump discredited ‚ÄúWestern Liberal Democracy with American characteristics‚Äù in a supremely effective way ‚Äì by re-electing Macron France has merely postponed its similarly honest examination of what their system really is: both fascist and PFAXIst.

New leaked documents from Biden‚Äôs struggling Department of Homeland Security reveal its failed plan to use its now defunct ‚ÄúDisinformation Governance Board‚Äù, intended to be led by a crazed 33 yr-old partisan activist, Nina Jankowicz, as a tool to direct social media platforms to remove any posts which government operatives deemed false, and to ‚Äúenforce an agenda‚Äù by controlling speech across a range of controversial topics including election fraud, COVID, vaccines, Russia and Ukraine.

Summary May PPI inflation year-on-year eases to 14-month low

May CPI year-on-year is in line with April's growth

BEIJING, June 10 (Reuters) - China's factory-gate inflation cooled to its slowest pace in 14 months in May, depressed by weak demand for steel, aluminium and other key industrial commodities due to tight COVID-19 curbs and bucking the global trend of rapidly accelerating prices.

The producer price index (PPI) rose 6.4% year-on-year, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Friday, after an 8.0% rise in April and in line with forecasts in a Reuters poll. It was the weakest reading since March 2021.

The consumer price index (CPI) gained 2.1% from a year earlier in May, in line with April's growth. In a Reuters poll, the CPI was expected to rise 2.2%.

The cooling inflation marks a sharp contrast to decades-high readings seen in other major economies and reflects the slump in demand due to China's strict COVID-19 controls, which has chilled factory and retail activity in recent months.

The modest price pressures also allow China's central bank to release more stimulus to prop up the economy even as monetary authorities in most other countries scramble to hose down inflation with aggressive interest rate hikes.

""Factory gate inflation will continue on its downward trajectory throughout the rest of the year,"" said Sheana Yue, China Economist at Capital Economics.

""Further policy rate cuts before long ‚Äì the first of which might come as soon as next Wednesday,"" she noted, referring to the People's Bank of China's medium-term liquidity operations next week.

The world's second-largest economy has slowed significantly in recent months, hit by strict COVID-19 controls, disrupting supply chains and jolting production and consumption.

China's cabinet in late May announced a package of 33 measures covering fiscal, financial, investment and industrial policies to revive its economy. read more

Last month, widespread COVID-19 lockdowns shut factories and stores, choking purchases of metals-intensive products from cars to appliances.

Chinese auto sales grew in May from April but were still down 16% year-on-year, according to the Chinese Passenger Car Association.

The urban jobless rate rose to 6.1% in April, the highest since February 2020 and well above the government's target ceiling of 5.5%.

Non-food prices rose 2.1% from a year earlier, 0.1 percentage point slower than the previous month, affecting the CPI by about 1.68 percentage points, the NBS said in a separate statement.

On a month-on-month basis, CPI fell 0.2%, swinging from a 0.4% rise in April.

""The CPI inflation remained stable. The rising commodity prices were offset by weak service prices such as travel and entertainment,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, Chief Economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.

""The transmission from PPI to CPI has turned out to be muted, because of weak domestic demand.""

3,https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/09/fbi-navarro-called-arresting-agents-nazis-00038610,"The government filing Thursday seems to mock Navarro‚Äôs priorities. It says FBI agents offered to contact an attorney for Navarro, but he wanted to use his phone to let a media outlet know he was likely to miss a scheduled TV interview.

When Navarro was offered a chance to call an attorney, according to the FBI agents, the defendant noted that he was preparing to proceed without one.

‚ÄúSA Giardina asked, ‚Äòdo you have an attorney you‚Äôd like to call? What is the name of your attorney?‚Äô‚Äù the FBI report says.

According to the report, Navarro replied: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm supposed to be on live television tonight. I‚Äôd like to call the producer and tell him I‚Äôm not going to be there. Can I have my phone?‚Äù

‚ÄúNAVARRO made statements to the effect that the arresting agents were ‚Äòkind Nazis‚Äô and ‚Äòhow could you live with yourselves?‚Äô‚Äù the report adds.

Navarro, in an email, said he‚Äôd made ‚Äúseveral requests‚Äù to call for legal advice when he was arrested.

‚ÄúThis was denied and my phone was confiscated,‚Äù he said.

While some of Navarro‚Äôs allies have claimed he was pulled off an airplane, the report says he was intercepted by the FBI in a jetway at the airport as he prepared to board an American Airlines commuter flight bound for Nashville.

Navarro has also claimed that he was shackled after his arrest. The FBI report mentions handcuffs but no shackles, nor does it address any security practices he might have encountered after he was handed over to deputy U.S. marshals at the courthouse in Washington last Friday.

The Justice Department‚Äôs filing came a day after the department urged the judge in Navarro‚Äôs case, Amit Mehta, to quickly enter a ‚Äúprotective order‚Äù preventing Navarro from disseminating evidence provided to him by prosecutors. Navarro is due in court to be arraigned on the charges on June 17, but he has requested a 45-day delay ‚Äî citing his effort to retain an attorney and to litigate a civil lawsuit against the department and the Jan. 6 select committee. The department said there was no legal basis to delay speedy-trial obligations to accommodate a civil lawsuit.

The department is urging Mehta to reject this request, noting that Navarro still has a week to obtain counsel and that his request for a delay would be disruptive to the case.

The FBI‚Äôs summary of Navarro‚Äôs arrest provides more details about the manner in which he was taken into custody. Navarro, who was accompanied by an unidentified individual, was in the jetway when he was taken into custody at 11:14 a.m., according to the agents. After he was led down the jetway steps, he was handcuffed and his wallet, cellphone and pen were taken and put in a manila envelope, the report indicates.

Navarro was taken to the FBI‚Äôs Washington Field Office for processing, including fingerprinting and a DNA sample, the report says.

After Navarro complained that his handcuffs were causing shoulder pain, they were replaced with a second set and loosened, which the agents said relieved Navarro‚Äôs discomfort. He initially rejected an offer of food, according to the summary, but asked for some at 12:08 p.m. and was given chocolate, nuts and dried fruit. He was later asked whether he wanted anything else to eat and declined, the report says.",0

King Philippe of Belgium expressed his ‚Äúdeepest regrets‚Äù for abuses committed during the country‚Äôs colonization of the Democratic Republic of Congo on Wednesday, but he did not offer a formal apology. The king made the remarks during his first visit to the central African country since he took the throne in 2013. He also handed back a wooden ceremonial mask brought to Belgium during the colonial period.

‚ÄúThis [colonial] regime was one of unequal relations, unjustifiable in itself, marked by paternalism, discrimination and racism,‚Äù he told the country‚Äôs parliament in Kinshasa, the capital, on Wednesday, Reuters reported. ‚ÄúOn the occasion of my first trip to Congo, right here, in front of the Congolese people and those who still suffer today, I wish to reaffirm my deepest regrets for those wounds of the past.‚Äù

Philippe and his wife, Queen Mathilde, received a warm welcome in Congo, where supporters of the ruling party waved Belgian flags and a banner hanging from parliament celebrated a ‚Äúcommon history,‚Äù according to Reuters. Congo‚Äôs president, F√©lix Tshisekedi, greeted the monarchs on a red carpet rolled out at the Kinshasa airport Tuesday. But some politicians and residents called for Belgium to go further to atone for the atrocities and discrimination their ancestors suffered.

At a news conference alongside Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, who traveled with the king and queen, Tshisekedi said he hoped stronger ties with Belgium would bring investment to Congo and improve health care. An estimated 73 percent of the Congolese population lives below the international poverty line, according to the World Bank.

‚ÄúWe have not dwelled on the past, which is the past and which is not to be reconsidered, but we need to look to the future,‚Äù Tshisekedi said, Reuters reported.

De Croo hailed the six-day trip as a ‚Äúhistoric moment.‚Äù

Belgium‚Äôs King Leopold II took power of Congo in 1885, when European leaders carved up Africa into imperial holdings. The king was given personal control over a swath of land he called the Congo Free State.

Some 10 million Congolese died from violence, famine and disease under Leopold‚Äôs direct rule, according to some estimates, and gruesome accounts emerged of the dismemberment of children in villages that did not produce enough rubber to satisfy their colonial overlords. Leopold‚Äôs rule was so bloody that it drew condemnation from other European leaders, and the government of Belgium later took over administration of the colony.

After the killing of George Floyd in the United States in 2020, protesters in Belgium vandalized statues of Leopold. Philippe‚Äôs comments this week echoed those he made in a letter to Tshisekedi that June, on the 60th anniversary of Congo‚Äôs independence, when he became the first Belgian official to voice regret for the country‚Äôs imperial abuses.

European countries have made some efforts in recent years to own up to their colonial pasts, as activists at home and in former colonies demand a reckoning over historical atrocities. In 2021, Germany apologized for massacres by German colonial forces of the Herero and Nama people in Namibia, which Germany has acknowledged as genocide. Dutch King Willem-Alexander apologized for the ‚Äúexcessive violence‚Äù the Netherlands used when it colonized Indonesia.

But most countries have not gone that far. French President Emmanuel Macron has launched efforts to probe France‚Äôs colonization of Algeria but ruled out issuing an official apology. Scars still run deep in both France and Algeria from the colonial period and the brutal war that ended it.

Some European nations have also moved to return artifacts looted from their former colonies. Philippe on Wednesday handed back to Congolese authorities a five-foot-tall Kakungu mask, which had been used in ceremonies by the Suku people in Congo‚Äôs southwest. The object was included in an inventory of 84,000 objects taken from Congo during the colonial period that the Belgian government gave to the Congolese government in February. Many are housed just outside Brussels, at Belgium‚Äôs Royal Museum for Central Africa.

The mask is on ‚Äúindefinite loan‚Äù to Congo, since Belgium does not have a legal avenue for donating works held in federal collections, according to Belgium‚Äôs VRT news site. Belgium‚Äôs legislature is weighing a law that will create a legal framework for the restitution of colonial-era artifacts.

Belgium also plans to return a tooth ‚Äî the last remains of Congo‚Äôs first post-independence prime minister, Patrice Lumumba ‚Äî who was killed in 1961 after a Brussels-backed coup.

For some in Congo, the gestures are not enough. Responding to a statement from De Croo on Twitter on Wednesday that the countries would pivot their focus to the future, Congolese opposition senator Francine Muyumba Nkanga wrote, ‚ÄúWe will never turn toward the future without apology and reparations from Belgium.‚Äù

51,https://21stcenturywire.com/2022/05/20/biden-orders-millions-of-monkeypox-vaccines-after-one-man-allegedly-infected/,"By



It appears that western governments and media are running with what Bill Gates foreshadowed as ‚Äòthe next pandemic‚Äô. This latest ‚Äòzoonotic‚Äô sensation appears be the obscure and exotic monkeypox virus, which has already grabbed the headlines, as members of the embryonic global government confab, the G7, are already throwing hundreds of millions in public money at Big Pharma supposedly to ‚Äòstop the spread.‚Äô D√©j√† vu, anyone?

Over in the UK, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has announced that the government will be stocking up on smallpox vaccines to help guard against the impending scourge of monkeypox. This, despite the fact that to date, there‚Äôs still no substantial science which proves or even remotely indicates that such a one-size-fits-all vaccine will do anything to stop the spread of the alleged virus.

Javid claims that another 11 supposed ‚Äòcases‚Äô of monkeypox have now been ‚Äòconfirmed‚Äô in the UK. However, no real evidence has been presented which definitively shows that any of these people are infected and sick due to a specific monkeypox virus derived from a patient sample which has been isolated and purified revealing a full virus present in nature. To date, the government has not shown they are in possession of such evidence.

So on which basis are these monkeypox diagnoses being made? By symptoms, and a PCR test? If so, how long ago was this PCR testing protocol developed, and was it ever peer reviewed? This is all beside the fact that the PCR test is not a legitimate diagnostic test.

Below the exciting headlines, Javid admits that ‚Äúmost cases‚Äù are said to be mild. Of course, this assessment has been relegated to a mere footnote, but this hasn‚Äôt stopped G7 health ministers from preparing to announce their comprehensive plan to ‚Äòstop the spread‚Äô of this new alleged virus,‚Äô which public health experts are now claiming has been detected in 9 other countries outside Central and West Africa.

Perhaps more concerning is the fact that the World Health Organization (WHO) are going to convene an emergency meeting this week on how to ‚Äòstop the spread.‚Äô In light of this Gates-funded organisation‚Äôs push for a globally-enforced WHO Pandemic Treaty, people should be both skeptical and worried as to where this latest global health scare is heading. Already we are seeing some of the same deceptive word and data sleight of hand games being played in the run-up to Covid lockdowns as governments and media adjuncts are keen to advance a new crisis narrative, as stated in a recent Newsweek report which made the following Covidesque statement:

‚ÄúThe illness tends to last for two to four weeks and has been shown to cause death in as many as 10 percent of people who catch it.‚Äù

Of course, there is no way anyone could possibly make such a general claim as to the alleged ‚Äòdeadliness‚Äô of this, or any other spontaneous exotic pathogen being touted by ‚Äòpublic health‚Äô officials or mainstream media outlets. Here we are witnessing the exact same fraud perpetrated by ‚Äòpublic health‚Äô officials and so-called experts when the Covid pandemic campaign was launched in winter of 2020 when their emergency response and policy prescriptions were driven by fear and hype, and based on guesswork and creative data modeling. We should know by now that such a wild, reactionary approach is a recipe for disaster, and yet, government and media seem ready to repeat their past failures again.

And just like that, with a flip of the ‚Äòglobal pandemic‚Äô switch, large tranches of public money are once again flowing freely into the pockets of the transnational pharmaceutical cartel, along with the various bio surveillance testing, technologies, PPE, and digital app rackets‚Ä¶

Newsweek reports‚Ä¶

The U.S. government has ordered millions of doses of a vaccine that protects against monkeypox. The news follows the first confirmed case in the states‚Äîa man in Massachusetts‚Äîfollowing an outbreak in the U.K.

The order amounts to a $119 million order for Jynneos vaccines, which are used for the prevention of both smallpox and monkeypox. It was announced by biotechnology company Bavarian Nordic, which makes the vaccine, on Wednesday.

The order will convert bulk vaccines, which have already been made and invoiced under previous contracts with the U.S. government, into freeze-dried versions which have an improved shelf-life.

The total government contract with Bavarian Nordic amounts to $299 million [share prices have surged following the announcement of a new prospective pandemic], which would provide 13 million freeze-dried doses.

It‚Äôs expected that the first doses will be manufactured by next year with further doses made in 2024 and 2025.

The order comes amid concern about monkeypox cases that have been reported in the U.K. with one case also being reported in Massachusetts.

Monkeypox is a viral disease first discovered in 1958 among colonies of monkeys that were being kept for research. The first human case was recorded in 1970.

Symptoms in humans may include fever, headache, body aches, swollen lymph nodes, chills, and exhaustion. Within a day or a few days of the fever, patients then develop a rash that spreads across the body.

The illness tends to last for two to four weeks and has been shown to cause death in as many as 10 percent of people who catch it.

On Wednesday, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) confirmed a single case of monkeypox in an adult male who had recently traveled to Canada. The health department said the case ‚Äúposes no risk to the public‚Äù and that the individual is hospitalized in good condition.

It is the first case of monkeypox to be detected in the country this year. In 2021, two U.S. cases were reported‚Ä¶

Lam also said the exodus of expatriates and foreigners from Hong Kong in recent months was not due to the newly enacted national security law ‚Äî seen by some as Beijing's tightening of its grip over the city ‚Äî but as a result of the the strict pandemic controls and measures that ""make people very impatient.""

""Sometimes you need the difficult situations [protests] to weaken people, this is something that we needed to do. The enactment of the national security law and subsequent improvements to increase stability,"" Lam said on CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia."" ""Stability is important to maintain enhanced Hong Kong as a financial center. Now that stability has been assured."" Hong Kong's national security law came into effect on June 30, 2020, before midnight on the eve of Hong Kong's July 1 anniversary marking its handover from British to Chinese rule. The city was gripped by months of protests ahead of the controversial law aimed at prohibiting secession, subversion of state power, terrorism activities and foreign interference.

'One country, two systems'

After the reunification of Hong Kong with mainland China in 1997, laws were put in place to guarantee the practice of ""one country, two systems"" principle for 50 years ‚Äî or until 2047. That framework makes Hong Kong a special administrative region of China but with limited election rights and a mostly separate legal and economic system.

When people complain there's no freedom, this is not the situation in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is as free as ever. Carrie Lam Hong Kong chief executive

Lam insisted that Hong Kong's freedoms and autonomy remained intact and had not expired ahead of 2047, despite propaganda pushed by some Western media outlets. ""I sometimes find it very disturbing that a lot of Western media try to portray Hong Kong as just another Chinese city and have no proper recognition or understanding of 'one country, two systems,'"" she said. She said mainland Chinese officials believed that the ""one country, two systems"" principle was the ""best institutional arrangement to ensure Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.""

Alongside Beijing, Lam said she looked forward to the ""continuation of what is in the Basic Law, including the upholding of the individual rights and freedoms, the practice of Hong Kong's capitalist system, and all the high degree of autonomy that has been given to Hong Kong."" ""When people complain there's no freedom, this is not the situation in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is as free as ever, whether it's in the freedom of expression, in the freedom of assembly, in the media, and so on.""

National security law

Despite the protests and riots, the implementation of the national security law and the earlier extradition bill were needed for Hong Kong to find its feet around the right laws to protect national interests, Lam said. She said this was crucial as Hong Kong had yet to establish its own institutions and legal systems to protect national interests, security and sovereignty more than two decades after the handover to China.

Freedoms are not absolute. Freedoms have to be sort of restrained, where there is a public interest. And no public interest could be more superior than national interest. Carrie Lam Hong Kong chief executive

Growing pains were part of this emancipation as seen with other protests before 2019, including the 79-day Occupy Central movement in 2014 when demonstrators demanded direct, universal suffrage to select the city's leader, Lam said. ""Freedoms are not absolute,"" Lam told CNBC. ""Freedoms have to be sort of restrained, where there is a public interest. And no public interest could be more superior than national interest."" ""So every place should have rules and laws in place to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests of the nation. Before the enactment of the national security law, Hong Kong was a vacuum insofar as those institutions and laws are concerned.""

On Covid and sanctions

Ahead of the two-year anniversary of the enactment of the national security law, the city continues to suffer increasing departures of foreign talent and international operations, but Lam said it was a temporary blip. Hong Kong's resilience is on full display with the number of people traveling to the city on the rise since the relaxation of quarantine periods to one week and the lifting of the ban on travelers from nine countries including the UK and the U.S. on April 1, Lam said. Daily arrivals at Hong Kong international airport multiplied ten-fold to 3,000 a day compared to 300 when the full suite of restrictions were in place before April, according to Lam.

... in order to perform our duty of loyalty, we must not be intimidated ‚Äî whether it is by abuse, by force, by sanctions or other means. Carrie Lam Hong Kong chief executive

Hong Kong's strict Covid-19 containment strategies were needed to protect Hong Kong's key travel corridor into the mainland, Lam said, but denied they were just a copy of the mainland's China's zero-Covid approach that has led to entire cities such as Shanghai shut down and economically crippled. ""The Hong Kong SAR government has a high degree of autonomy in determining how to tackle a public health crisis. But the reality is, our people need to travel to the mainland, but at the same time, we need a very strong international connectivity,"" she said. ""That's why throughout the last two and half years, we have been trying to strike a balance that will enable us to meet both objectives.""",0

Suleyman has already hired several of his former colleagues. Bloomberg | Getty Images

Artificial intelligence gurus are quitting top jobs at companies like Google, Meta, OpenAI and DeepMind and joining a new breed of start-ups that want to take AI to the next level, according to people familiar with the matter and LinkedIn analysis. Four of the best-funded new AI start-ups ‚Äî Inflection, Cohere, Adept and Anthropic ‚Äî have recently poached dozens of AI scientists with backgrounds in Big Tech. Their hiring efforts are being fueled by venture capital firms and billionaires keen to cash in on any success they have. Collectively, these firms have raised over $1 billion and they're using these vast war chests to poach talented individuals who command high salaries from their previous employers. The start-ups are building their products and services with a relatively new ""architecture,"" which is a set of rules and methods that's used to describe the functionality, organization and implementation of a computer system. The new architecture ‚Äî developed by a team of Google staff in 2017 and now available for anyone to use ‚Äî is known as a ""transformer."" The transformer allows AI systems to be scaled in ways that had never been considered before, meaning it's possible to make them far more powerful and capable. ""When you started scaling up these models, the capabilities just grew in a way that I think no one predicted,"" Cohere CEO Aidan Gomez told CNBC. ""It was like a total shock."" OpenAI's GPT-3 and Dalle-E, Google's Bert, and DeepMind's AlphaFold and AlphaStar are all examples of breakthrough AI systems that are underpinned by a transformer.

Inflection AI

Launched in March, Inflection AI has already raised over $225 million despite having fewer than 10 employees, according to LinkedIn. Headquartered in California, the company's aim is to develop AI software products that make it easier for humans to communicate with computers. It is led by DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman, who recently left his VP of AI product management and AI policy role at Google. LinkedIn billionaire Reid Hoffman and former DeepMind researcher Karen Simonyan are the other co-founders. Suleyman has already hired several of his former colleagues. Former DeepMinder Heinrich Kuttler left his research engineering manager role at Meta AI in London in March to become a member of the founding team at Inflection, working on the technical side of the business, according to his LinkedIn page. Elsewhere, Joe Fenton left his senior product manager role at Google in February also to become a member of the founding team at Inflection, working on the product side of the business. More recently, Rewon Child, a former Google Brain and OpenAI researcher, joined Inflection as a member of technical staff. Inflection has also hired Maarten Bosma, who was previously a research engineer at Google. Meta and Google did not respond to a CNBC request for comment. One of Inflection's best-known investors is Greylock Partners, a renowned venture capital firm in Silicon Valley that made early bets on the likes of Facebook (now Meta) and Airbnb. Hoffman and Suleyman are partners at the firm. On a call with CNBC in March, Suleyman said: ""If you think about the history of computing, we have always been trying to reduce the complexity of our ideas in order to communicate them to a machine."" He added: ""Even when we write a search query, we're simplifying, we're reducing or we're writing in shorthand so that the search engine can understand what we want."" When humans want to control a computer, they need to learn a programming language in order to provide instructions, he added, or use a mouse to navigate and engage with things on the screen. ""All of these are ways we simplify our ideas and reduce their complexity and in some ways their creativity and their uniqueness in order to get a machine to do something,"" Suleyman said. The British entrepreneur claimed a new suite of technologies that Inflection will aim to develop will eventually enable anyone to speak to a computer in plain language. It's unclear at this stage who Inflection will sell its products to, at what price, and when.

Cohere

Inflection is competing for talent with Cohere, which was founded in Toronto in 2019 by Aidan Gomez, Ivan Zhang and Nick Frosst. Cohere, which has raised around $170 million from the likes of Index Ventures and Tiger Global, wants to create an interface that allows software developers to use complicated AI technology on their apps. This AI technology, known as natural language processing, or NLP, should allow developers to deploy new features and services into their software products. ""We want to build that toolkit that's accessible to any dev,"" CEO Gomez told CNBC on a call. AI luminaries and DeepMind alums Ed Grefenstette and Phil Blunsom are among the latest AI scientists to join Cohere, with the duo announcing last month that they've joined the firm. Grefenstette is Cohere's head of machine learning and Blunsom is the company's chief scientist. They'll also be responsible for helping to set up a new Cohere office in London, which has become a hotbed for AI talent over the last decade. Indeed, DeepMind now employs over a thousand people in the city, many of them PhDs. They'll likely be able to scout out promising potential recruits from two of the U.K.'s leading universities. Grefenstette is an honorary professor at UCL, while Blunsom is a professor at Oxford.

Anthropic

Another firm making waves is Anthropic, which is led by OpenAI's former VP of research Dario Amodei. Anthropic describes itself as an AI safety and research company. It says that it wants to build ""reliable interpretable, and steerable AI systems."" Amodei set up the firm with help from several other ex-OpenAI employees, including Jack Clark, Tom Brown, Sam McCandlish and his sister Daniela Amodei. It launched in 2021 and announced it had secured $124 million from a cohort of investors including Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. In April, the company announced it raised another $580 million, and according to LinkedIn, it now has 41 staff.

20,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/06/10/politics/alejandro-mayorkas-interview-cnntv/index.html,"Los Angeles (CNN) The Biden administration has launched an ""unprecedented"" operation to disrupt human smuggling networks amid an ongoing influx of migrants at the US-Mexico border, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas exclusively told CNN.

The operation -- which includes deploying hundreds of personnel throughout Latin America and a multi-million-dollar investment -- comes as the US continues to grapple with a large flow of migrants to the US-Mexico border, including this week as a caravan of up to 5,000 migrants journeys north from southern Mexico.

""We have brought an all-of-government effort to attack the smuggling organizations. It's not just Homeland Security Investigations, it's not just US Customs and Border Protection. But we're working very carefully with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a number of agencies within the Department of Justice, and, of course, our partners in Mexico,"" Mayorkas told CNN.

""I think it's scale and scope; it's tactics and strategy. It's really unprecedented,"" he added.

Mayorkas is attending the Ninth Summit of the Americas, which is being hosted by the United States in Los Angeles. The gathering of nearly two dozen heads of states from the Western Hemisphere has focused on stabilizing the region and investing in it to, in part, stem the flow migration -- an issue that has dogged US presidents, including Joe Biden, for years.

The mass migration within the hemisphere came into sharp focus again this week, as thousands of migrants joined a caravan heading to the US southern border. Asked about how the latest operation applies to that caravan, Mayorkas stressed the administration is ""tackling the smuggling organizations that exploit these people.""

The ""Sting Operation,"" led by the Department of Homeland Security, has so far yielded around 20,000 ""disruption actions"" that include arrests and prosecutions, seizures of property and criminal investigations, according to the department. The US has also surged over 1,300 personnel throughout the Western Hemisphere and invested over $50 million.

In the last eight weeks, nearly 2,000 smugglers have been arrested, marking a 600% increase in law enforcement actions taken against such actors compared to efforts in previous years, DHS said.

The latest operation builds upon previous initiatives by the Biden administration to go after smugglers who migrants often depend on as they make their way to the US-Mexico border. Last spring, DHS also announced an effort to crack down on criminal smuggling organizations, alongside federal partners.

DHS also set up a new intelligence gathering and law enforcement unit to monitor the movement of migrants and helped stand up a task force, led by the Justice Department, to investigate and prosecute human smuggling and trafficking networks.

Migration looms over Summit of the Americas

At the US southern border, a new trend has been taking shape that's posed a challenge to the Biden administration: About 40% of border crossers are now from countries outside of Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.

More than 6 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants have fled the country, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Nicaraguans have also increasingly been migrating, as well as Haitians who had moved to the region years ago.

Over the course of Summit of the Americas, administration officials have acknowledged the mass migration in the Western Hemisphere, stressing the need for all countries to help alleviate the flow and create better conditions in country.

The gathering has served as a platform for the Biden administration, leaders of countries in the region, and the public and private sector to come to agreements about the path forward in stemming the flow of irregular migration.

Biden has aimed to demonstrate a level of cohesion across the two continents' politics, but boycotts by leaders of several nations -- including Mexico and three Central American countries -- has put a damper on the summit.

The four leaders refused to attend because Biden declined to extend invitations to the three autocratic leaders, instead sending lower-level delegations.

Mayorkas dismissed concerns about key leaders skipping the summit, telling CNN: ""All the countries are represented here. So, of course, the president of Mexico is not here but I had the good fortune of seeing the foreign minister of Mexico, Secretary Ebrard, here with whom I have worked very closely throughout my trips to Mexico as well as our continuing dialogue. So no, my confidence is unblemished.""

New funding for stabilization efforts

On Friday, against the backdrop of the Summit of the Americas, Biden announced a regional partnership to address mass migration in the Western Hemisphere. The agreement, dubbed the Los Angeles declaration, was signed onto by 20 Western Hemisphere nations.

The agreement ""is centered around responsibility sharing and economic support for countries that have been most impacted by refugee and migration flows,"" a senior administration official said ahead of Friday's unveiling.

Under the declaration, governments are expected to commit to expanding temporary worker programs, bolstering legal pathways like refugee resettlement and family reunification, providing support to countries hosting large migrant populations, and cracking down on human smuggling networks.

Speaking at an event unveiling the declaration alongside other signatories, Biden said, ""No nation should bear this responsibility alone."" The President also asserted it was on ""every country"" to maintain orderly and human migration process.

""We need to halt the dangerous and unlawful ways that people are migrating,"" he continued. ""Unlawful migration is not acceptable.""

Biden also underscored that human traffickers would not be tolerated, saying, ""If you prey on desperate and vulnerable migrants for profit, we are coming for you.""

The US announced $314 million in new federal funding for ""stabilization efforts in the Americas,"" according to a White House factsheet. Leading up to the Summit of the Americas, administration officials repeatedly stressed the need to support countries in the region who are hosting migrants and refugees, especially Venezuelans who have fled their origin country in large numbers.

The funding is part of a concerted effort to encourage countries throughout the Western Hemisphere to share the responsibility as it relates to migration in the hemisphere and provide opportunity to migrants in hopes of stemming irregular migration.

Colombia and Ecuador, for example, are among the countries providing support to Venezuelans and have committed to providing a path to legal status within their countries for those migrants.

Canada also plans to bolster its efforts by increasing the number of refugees it admits from the Americas to up to 4,000 by 2028. Similarly, the US will resettle 20,000 refugees from the Americas over the next two years, marking an increase from previous years. And Spain will ""double the number of labor pathways for Hondurans,"" the fact sheet says.

While at the summit this week, Biden has stressed economic opportunity in the region and providing jobs, which is reflected in the latest slate of migration commitments.

The US Department of Agriculture announced a pilot program to support US farmers in hiring agricultural workers under existing temporary work visas. Mexico committed to integrating thousands of refugees into the Mexican labor market over the next three years, while Canada said it will take in more than 50,000 agricultural workers from Mexico, Guatemala and the Caribbean this year.

When asked by reporters how the US plans to keep on tabs on the various commitments, a senior administration official said it would be an ""ongoing dialogue.""

The Covid-19 pandemic has abated in much of the world and, with it, many of the social restrictions implemented to curb its spread, as people have been eager to return to pre-lockdown life. But in its place have emerged a series of viruses behaving in new and peculiar ways. Take seasonal influenza, more commonly known as the flu. The 2020 and 2021 U.S. winter flu seasons were some of the mildest on record both in terms of deaths and hospitalizations. Yet cases ticked up in February and climbed further into the spring and summer as Covid restrictions were stripped back. ""We've never seen a flu season in the U.S. extend into June,"" Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director for infection prevention at Yale New Haven Hospital, told CNBC Tuesday. ""Covid has clearly had a very big impact on that. Now that people have unmasked, places are opening up, we're seeing viruses behave in very odd ways that they weren't before,"" he said. And flu is just the beginning.

We are seeing very atypical behaviors in a number of ways for a number of viruses. Dr Scott Roberts associate medical director for infection prevention, Yale New Haven Hospital

Respiratory syncytial virus, a cold-like virus common during winter months, exhibited an uptick last summer, with cases surging among children in Europe, the U.S and Japan. Then, in January this year, an outbreak of adenovirus 41, usually responsible for gastrointestinal illness, became the apparent cause of a mysterious and severe liver disease among young children. Elsewhere, Washington State has been experiencing its worst flare-up of tuberculosis in 20 years. And now, a recent outbreak of monkeypox, a rare viral infection typically found in Central and West Africa, is baffling health experts with over 1,000 confirmed and suspected cases emerging in 29 non-endemic countries.

Viruses behaving badly

At least two genetically distinct monkeypox variants are now circulating in the U.S., likely stemming from two different spillover infections from animals to humans, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week. The World Health Organization noted earlier last week that the virus, whose symptoms include fever and skin lesions, may have been going undetected in society for ""months or possibly a couple of years.""

""The two strains probably indicate this has been going on longer than we first thought. We're at a concerning time right now,"" said Roberts. He noted that the coming weeks will be telling for the course of the virus, which has an incubation period of 5 to 21 days. It is not yet clear whether the smallpox-like virus has mutated, though health experts have reported that it is behaving in new and atypical ways. Most notably, it appears to be spreading within the community ‚Äî most commonly through sex ‚Äî as opposed to via travel from places where it is typically found. Symptoms are also appearing in new ways. ""Patients are presenting differently than we were previously taught,"" said Roberts, noting that some infected patients are bypassing initial flu-like symptoms and immediately developing rashes and lesions, specifically and unusually on the genitals and anus. ""There's a lot of unknowns that do make me uneasy. We are seeing very atypical behaviors in a number of ways for a number of viruses,"" he said.

Restrictions reduce exposure, immunity

One explanation, of course, is that Covid-induced restrictions and mask-wearing over the past two years have given other infectious diseases little opportunity to spread in the ways they once did. Where viruses did manage to slip through, they were frequently missed as public health surveillance centered largely on the pandemic. That indeed was the case in Washington's tuberculosis outbreak, according to local health authorities, who said parallels between the two illnesses allowed TB cases to go undiagnosed.

During the Covid pandemic, access to primary care, including childhood vaccinations, was unavailable to many children. Jennifer Horney professor of epidemiology, University of Delaware

Now, as pandemic-induced restrictions have eased and usual habits resumed, viruses that were in retreat have found a fertile breeding ground in newly social and travel-hungry hosts. The recent monkeypox outbreak is thought to have stemmed, at least in part, from two mass events in Europe, a lead adviser to the WHO said last month. Meantime, two years of reduced exposure have lowered individual immunity to diseases and made society as a whole more vulnerable. That is especially true for young children ‚Äî typically germ amplifiers ‚Äî who missed opportunities to gain antibodies against common viruses, either through their mother's womb or early years socializing.

Missed childhood vaccinations

That could explain the uptick in curious severe acute hepatitis cases among children, according to health experts who are looking into possible links to Covid restrictions. ""We are also exploring whether increased susceptibility due to reduced exposure during the Covid-19 pandemic could be playing a role,"" the U.K. Health Security Agency said in April.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also expressed concern that lockdowns may have caused many children to miss childhood vaccinations, potentially raising the risks of other vaccine-preventable illnesses such as measles and pertussis. ""During the Covid pandemic, access to primary care, including childhood vaccinations, was unavailable to many children,"" Jennifer Horney, professor of epidemiology at the University of Delaware, told CNBC. ""To prevent increases in these diseases, catch-up vaccination campaigns are needed globally,"" she added.

Beware surveillance bias

That said, there is also now greater awareness and surveillance of public health issues in the wake of the pandemic, making diagnoses of some outbreaks more commonplace. ""Covid has raised the profile of public health matters so that we are perhaps paying more attention to these events when they occur,"" said Horney, adding that public health systems set up to identify Covid have also helped diagnose other diseases. Professor Eyal Leshem, infectious disease specialist at Sheba Medical Center, agreed: ""The general population and the media have become much more interested in zoonotic outbreaks and infectious diseases.""

10,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/06/09/americas/dom-phillips-bruno-pereira-missing-suspect-intl-latam/index.html,"(CNN) Brazilian authorities said Wednesday they have detained a suspect in the case of a missing British journalist and indigenous affairs expert -- but are yet to establish whether the man was linked to their disappearance in a remote region of the Amazon.

Concerns are growing over the fate of Dom Phillips and Bruno Ara√∫jo Pereira, who were first reported missing in the Javari Valley , in the far western part of Amazonas state on Sunday. They had reportedly received death threats just days prior.

In a news conference Wednesday, Amazonas state security secretary general Carlos Alberto Mansur said the suspect remains under investigation in police custody.

Mansur said the man was arrested after being found in possession of ""a lot of drugs"" and ammunition used for illegal hunting.

Authorities said Wednesday they were pursuing several lines of investigation, including homicide, and added they still ""can't rule out anything.""

Gen. Placido (center) speaks between Eduardo Alexandre Fontes (right), Regional Superintendent of Amazonas State Federal Police and Col. Muniz during a news conference in Manaus, Brazil, on Wednesday.

Mansur noted that five other people have also been questioned by police in connection with the disappearance of Phillips and Pereira, who had traveled to the region to conduct research for a book project on conservation efforts in the region.

Ahead of the news conference, media organizations and family members of both missing men called for the federal government to step up their search efforts. Federal Police Superintendent Eduardo Alexandre Fontes said Wednesday that a total of 250 men, two helicopters, three drones and 16 boats have been deployed for the search and rescue operation.

Phillips and Pereira have been missing for more than 72 hours, according to the Coordination of the Indigenous Organization. The organization, known as UNIVAJA, said satellite information showed the pair's last known location in the S√£o Rafael community early on Sunday morning, where they were expected to meet a local leader who never showed up.

A ""dangerous"" region

Home to thousands of indigenous people and about 16 uncontacted groups, the Javari Valley -- the second largest indigenous territory in Brazil -- is a patchwork of rivers and dense forest that makes access very difficult. The area has come under increased threat from illegal miners, loggers, hunters and international drug traffickers exploiting its vast network of rivers.

On Wednesday, Federal Police Superintendent Fontes described the area where Phillips and Pereira went missing as ""complicated"" and ""dangerous.""

Phillips and Pereira had traveled to the region to conduct research for a book on conservation efforts there. Phillips, an Amazon specialist, had previously reported for British newspaper The Guardian on threats posed by illegal mining and cattle ranchers to uncontacted indigenous groups in the region.

Despite being under government protection, the Javari Valley can be a hostile environment for journalists and indigenous rights activists. According to Brazil's Public Prosecutor's Office, an indigenous affairs worker was murdered in the area in September 2019.

""In this region, violence is advancing in an increasingly uncontrolled manner in the context of the invasion of indigenous lands and lands that belong to the state, repression of the freedom of press and the work of journalists,"" UNIVAJA said in a statement.

In 2018, Phillips reported on the threats posed by illegal mining and cattle ranchers to uncontacted indigenous groups there, with Pereira at the heart of that article.

Survival International, an NGO that advocates for indigenous peoples, said Pereira had previously received ""many threats"" as a result of his work as an ""ally of the Indigenous struggle.""",1

Now, billionaire Betsy DeVos has written a new book titled ‚ÄúHostages to the Cause: The Fight for Education and the Future of the American Child‚Äù that will be released on June 21, 2022. In her new book, DeVos trashes her former boss and falsely attempts to tie him to the violence on January 6.

In a USA Today interview, DeVos blames President Trump for failing to ‚Äúaddress the situation.‚Äù

She even raised the 25th Amendment issue directly with Vice President Mike Pence, who would have become temporary president had the amendment procedures actually been carried out.

Curiously, while trashing President Trump, Betsy DeVos, who likes to think of herself as the kingmaker in Michigan GOP politics, is simultaneously supporting the GOP candidate for governor in Michigan, Tudor Dixon, who has NOT been endorsed by President Trump but has gone out of her way to appear with him for photo ops.

While Dixon may be a good candidate, having the appearance of the DeVos family controlling her decisions could be problematic for the young mother of four, as grassroots voters want nothing to do with anyone they perceive as being owned by the never-Trump billionaire.

Democrats are going to push this from now until November.

They have nothing else to talk about.

50,https://pieceofmindful.com/2020/04/06/bombshell-who-coronavirus-pcr-test-primer-sequence-is-found-in-all-human-dna/,"DISCLAIMER: Please read before proceeding‚Ä¶ A previous writer at Piece of Mindful posted this initial ‚Äúfinding‚Äù on April 6, 2020, and subsequently a ‚Äúsoft‚Äù retraction on October 7, 2020 https://pieceofmindful.com/2020/10/07/0-0000000000000000014552/#more-89098, in light of new information indicating that the implications of his finding may be in dispute. Despite the fact that some researchers are continuing to reference the initial post (the claim of which we cannot stand fully behind at this time), it should NOT detract from, nor negate, scientifically valid points they may posit with regard to the fallacious RT-PCR process, the purported ‚Äúisolation‚Äù of the alleged SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the highly deceptive ‚Äúsequencing‚Äù of said virus. Note: Current writers of this blog are in FULL support of Dr. Tom Cowan, Sally Fallon and Dr. Andrew Kaufman ‚Äî as evidenced in recent posts ‚Äî and we do NOT endorse self-proclaimed ‚Äúdebunkers‚Äù of their well-intentioned and nearly impeccable work.

This was important enough that I wanted to get it out immediately. My research into the NCBI database for nucleotide sequences has lead to a stunning discovery. One of the WHO primer sequences in the PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 is found in all human DNA!

The sequence ‚ÄúCTCCCTTTGTTGTGTTGT‚Äù is an 18-character primer sequence found in the WHO coronavirus PCR testing protocol document. The primer sequences are what get amplified by the PCR process in order to be detected and designated a ‚Äúpositive‚Äù test result. It just so happens this exact same 18-character sequence, verbatim, is also found on Homo sapiens chromosome 8! As far as I can tell, this means that the WHO test kits should find a positive result in all humans. Can anyone explain this otherwise?

I really cannot overstate the significance of this finding. At minimum, it should have a notable impact on test results.

Homo sapiens chromosome 8, GRCh38.p12 Primary Assembly

Sequence ID: NC_000008.11 Length: 145138636

Range 1: 63648346 to 63648363 is ‚ÄúCTCCCTTTGTTGTGTTGT‚Äù

Update: After some effort, I have finally discovered a way to display proof (beyond my screenshots) that human chromosome 8 has this exact same 18-character sequence. Please try the link below. The sequence is shown at the bottom of the page.

But as we accelerate into the metaverse and barrel towards next-generation advancements like Web3, it's critical to proceed with caution. Unless we develop new technologies with inclusivity in mind at the start, we risk a future that will only deepen the disparities that already negatively affect women and other disenfranchised communities, like the digital divide, the gender gap and the STEM gap.

Those were the stakes that informed discussions in late April during Women Rule: The Exchange, which brought together women academics, policymakers and business leaders for a half-day of dialogue in Washington. Participants joined roundtables, listened to experts in public-facing events, and shared their personal experiences, challenges and hopes for the future. But, for all, the message was clear: in order to make progress in innovation, women must advocate for other women, even ‚Äî and especially ‚Äî when those women don't yet have a seat at the table themselves.

Addressing bias

As women rise to take on leadership positions in government and business, they frequently encounter systemic bias and spaces where women's voices haven't historically been a part of the conversation. Take the case of Jessica Rosenworcel, the first woman to be confirmed as the permanent chair of the Federal Communications Commission in the organization's 87-year history. Frequently, she's the only woman in meetings, and says that comes with a sense of responsibility. ‚ÄúIt has trained me to constantly think about who's not present, whose opinion isn't being voiced, what communities might be overlooked or left behind by the decisions we're making,‚Äù Rosenworcel said.

It's that kind of absence that actually inspired a business idea for entrepreneur Anu Duggal, who experienced firsthand the challenge of accessing venture capital funding, which predominantly goes to companies led by men. In fact, in 2021, only 2 percent of VC dollars went to companies founded by women, according to PitchBook ‚Äî and that's an 83 percent improvement from 2020. Seeking to change that, Duggal launched Female Founders Fund in 2014 to invest exclusively in enterprises founded by women. Quickly, she learned she was not exempt from bias: she coordinated more than 700 meetings over two years to raise an initial $6 million. ‚ÄúIt took a lot of resilience,‚Äù she said. Today, the fund manages more than $700 million and is one of many firms focused on women. ‚ÄúSo, the world has definitely evolved,‚Äù said Duggal, ‚Äúbut there's still a long way to go.‚Äù

Getting connected

The disparities in access run deep for women and start early in women's careers. Not only are they less likely to pursue jobs in tech-related fields, they're less likely to even have access to technology. Globally, just 30 percent of STEM workers are women, and 57 percent of women use the internet compared to 62 percent of men, according to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). In the U.S., both the private sector and the government are addressing the problem by expanding access to broadband.

During Covid-19, the importance of internet access became abundantly clear as schools, workplaces, government and health care went remote. Kathy Grillo, Verizon's senior vice president, public policy and government affairs, says that Verizon has focused on ways to make services more accessible and affordable to all to help close that gap. ‚ÄúWhat we've tried to focus on is how do we get our product out to as many people as possible?‚Äù says Grillo. To help achieve that goal, Verizon offers free high-speed broadband service to participants in the FCC's Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) who subscribe to Fios.

At the FCC, prior to the pandemic, Rosenworcel had already been working to address something called the ‚Äúhomework gap,‚Äù which refers to as many as 17 million students in the U.S. who have internet access in school but not at home. Covid-19 exacerbated that need. Working with Congress, the FCC helped set up a $7 billion fund to get more than 12.5 million kids connected. ‚ÄúEvery one of us needs a broadband connection to have a fair shot at 21st-century success,‚Äù said Rosenworcel. ‚ÄúAnd the more people we get connected, the more women we get connected, I think the more creative our economy and vibrant our culture will be.‚Äù

A diverse workforce drives good business

When women are missing from decision-making positions in the workplace, the results affect consumers, especially women consumers. Consider the recent changes around crash test dummies. Safety tests performed in cars use dummies shaped like the average man from the 1970s, and those dummies do not account for differences between men's and women's bodies. In February, more than 60 members of Congress urged Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to advocate for the use of female crash test dummies in vehicle safety tests.

Participants also shared examples of how their companies are working to elevate women's voices in leadership and how that will benefit consumers. Grillo said that at Verizon, a broader representation leads to better business decisions. ‚ÄúHaving a lot of women in leadership positions means that we build our products, we think about our services and how our networks run with respect to men and women and everyone,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúIt's important to offer women the opportunities to learn, grow and advance, and be visible in leadership roles,‚Äù said Roshan Roeder, Northrop Grumman's vice president and general manager, airborne multifunction sensors. ‚ÄúOur company is led by women, including Kathy Warden our CEO, and we have multiple women on our board of directors. We host networking at women‚Äôs conferences, promote mentoring programs and create areas for innovation like maker spaces,‚Äù she said.

Not all organizations are able to make strides for women in tech at the pace necessary for substantial change. For that, government leadership could be instrumental, said Elaine Chao, former U.S. Secretary of Transportation and former U.S. Secretary of Labor. Government plays a powerful role as a convener, said Chao, and can establish advisory committees of experts who conduct research and propose solutions as to why women are underrepresented in certain fields.

Making new inroads

At the heart of innovation is its ability to shake up old systems and establish new frameworks. That's been the case with investors in cryptocurrency, the majority of whom are black and Latino, said Cleve Mesidor, executive director of the Blockchain Foundation. And yet, even there, gender disparities remain: men are twice as likely as women to invest in crypto.

Recently, celebrities including Reese Witherspoon, Gwyneth Paltrow and Mila Kunis have encouraged women to invest in cryptocurrency. Mesidor said that's a positive step, but she wants women across all racial and socioeconomic demographics to be able to see themselves working in the industry. In that vein, she's frequently correcting misconceptions about the barriers to entry in blockchain technology careers. She likes to tell women that if they can master Excel, they can master AI, and find a path to high-earning jobs. ‚ÄúYou can get a certificate program today in AI, in cybersecurity, in VR and get a job making $75,000 in six months,‚Äù she said.

At its best, innovation in tech is driven by optimism and the desire to solve problems for consumers. Just as each generation of technology improves on the last, we can hope for the same for each generation of humans, as we learn from past errors and omissions. As we work towards that future, Rosenworcel reiterated how important it is for women to help one another so that we can all move forward together.

‚ÄúThe advice that I always pass along is something that [the first African-American Congresswoman] Shirley Chisholm once said, which is, 'If they don't give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair.‚Äô‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúPeople won't always make space for you. So you're going to have to make a space for yourself. And when you succeed in doing that, be someone who brings someone else along.‚Äù",0

In my video entitled ‚ÄòWe Have Eight Months‚Äô, published on 9th April 2022, I warned of soaring food prices, mass starvation with hundreds of millions dying, rapidly rising fuel prices, profiteering, inflation soaring past 10% and a developing recession. Some of these things I had forecast over two years ago before.

I suspect that many people thought I was exaggerating.

I wonder if they still feel that way.

Everything I forecast is happening very rapidly.

And politicians and bankers are sitting back doing nothing.

At the Bank of England (where pensioners are getting an 11% rise in their pensions this summer ‚Äì compared to 3% for those relying on the State pensions) bankers and other staff are allowed to go into work just one day a week.

Every day brings another addition to the crisis, but the mainstream media seems still obsessed with two footballers‚Äô wives and a libel case. I wonder how many staff at the BBC have heard of Nero fiddling while Rome burnt.

The latest threat we have to face comes from the World Health Organisation which, as I reported weeks ago, threatens the sovereignty and democracy of every nation.

Governments everywhere are handing over power to the World Health Assembly, which is about to become the proof that the conspirators are planning a World Government. Our new ruler will be the secretary general of the WHO (‚Äòadvised‚Äô, no doubt, by Bill Gates).

AND BY POST

Dear Sirs,

Request for an Urgent Review regarding forthcoming WHA agenda item

I am writing on behalf of Dr. R. Zac Cox BDS regarding serious concerns arising from the current proposal for an agenda item on the 75th World Health Assembly (WHA) namely the proposed amendments to the International Health Regulations 2005 (IHR). Proposed agenda item 16.2 (12th April 2022).

Link to IHR: https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241580410.

Link to proposed amendments: https://www.medicdebate.org/files/C.L.2.2022-IHR-amendments-English.pdf

75th WHA Agenda Item

It is understood that at the 75th WHA, due to commence on 22nd May 2022 in Geneva, amendments to IHR are proposed by America and these are sponsored by the UK (along with 19 other Member States (MSs)). It is further understood that such amendments will be subject to a vote by MS delegates and almost certainly adopted by each MS in accordance with the IHR and World Health Organisation (WHO) constitution (thereafter being adopted into National legislation in accordance with IHR).

Consequences of WHA agenda item

A direct consequence of the delegation to the WHA delegate at the 75th WHA is to allow adoption of a policy that delegates potential, if not absolute, decision-making authority to WHO Director General (DG) as to decisions for regional and intermediate lockdown measures (which currently only relate to advice for international situations).

As set out below, the harms that can result from such lockdowns are not only far-reaching but substantial in terms of financial damage to the country as well as individuals. A large body of experts now consider that lockdown measures are harmful and neither ‚Äúsafe nor effective‚Äù all arguments to the contrary notwithstanding.

Constitutional and Human Rights issues

The fundamental human rights protected by the ECHR are clearly of relevance. Furthermore, issues of constitutional change are clearly of the utmost importance and one must do all to ensure that justice is not just done but is seen to be done and that fundamental natural law rights and freedoms are not breached or curtailed/infringed. Proportionality and greater justification of reasons for delegation and use of discretion are clearly essential where constitutional and human rights issues are concerned. Use of discretion and delegation of powers must be as Parliament intended.

Lack of transparency/Public Interest

Public awareness of the powers of WHO, the DG of WHO, IHR, WHA, delegation of voting powers at WHA, the American proposed amendments to IHR, sponsorship by UK of these proposed amendments and the far-reaching nature of these (in the context of Human Rights to a WHO delegate) is negligible if not completely absent.

Public awareness and calls for action to oppose the ‚ÄúPandemic Treaty‚Äù due to concerns of loss of sovereignty to WHO have begun (see for example https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/614335 ‚Äì The WHO is currently preparing an international agreement on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response.

We believe the public must be furnished with the full ramifications of what and how any pandemic treaty could affect them, and be given a public vote on whether the UK should sign up, before the UK Government signs up to this) when the commencement date is in fact not until 2024 but the proposed amendments to the IHR are not within general public knowledge despite the imminent WHA this month in May 2022 and the likely adoption of the proposed amendments at the 75th WHA which result in more far reaching outcome than the Pandemic Treaty.

Urgent request for review

This letter should be considered as a request for an immediate/urgent review to the decision not to publicise, obtain parliamentary scrutiny and or public consultation of the agenda item before it‚Äôs adoption/discussion at the 75th WHA starting on 22nd May 2022. Such review to be made with reference to the material and information contained in this letter and/or an indication that knowledge of this government decision to delegate consideration of amendments to IHR is deemed appropriate when such far-reaching harms could result from the amendments if adopted (without public awareness of the significance, without parliamentary scrutiny and without public consultation).

In light of the high-profile Brexit decisions and related government claim of maintaining sovereignty, such delegation of powers to DG of WHO (and delegation of such decision-making for amendments to a WHA delegates) giving powers with far-reaching consequences by way of amending international regulations seems to be incompatible and potentially inadvertent/unwitting oxymoron.

The lawfulness of the proposed amendments to IHR appears to be questionable and the delegation of adopting such amendments equally so (given their far reaching potential constitutional effect and the lack of public awareness and/or parliamentary scrutiny).

By way of an example of the effect of adoption of the proposed amendments:

DG can listen to another Member State (MS) to give information (not requiring evidence) no matter their motive which could cause harm (financial) to UK, DG acts on this information, recommends lockdown in UK causing financial harm in UK and HR issues to UK nationals (incompatible with ‚Äúthe Convention Rights‚Äô: eg Article 5,8,9,10,11,14, and Protocol 1, Article 2: Right to education).

Please consider, therefore, a review of UK sponsorship and inclusion as an agenda issue in light of the following:-

amendments were sponsored without public awareness and without public scrutiny or public consultation

constitutional amendment regarding delegation of potential sovereign rights to an unelected body in the context of it (i) being unknown (ii) IHR scope being unknown (iii) proposed IHR amendments being unknown (iv) UK sponsorship of proposed amendments being unknown (v) WHA agenda and powers being unknown (vi) delegate voting at WHA on UK behalf unknown.

Whether a failure to now review sponsorship of such a constitutional matter is either ultra vires and or Wednesbury unreasonable especially given the delegation aspect and the complete lack of transparency of the regulations, amendments and delegation of decision-making as well as the resulting delegation of power and therefore sovereignty.

Whether it is an abuse of, or unlawful use of, or improper purpose of use of discretion- i.e. improper delegation to a currently unknown WHO delegate and where it is unknown if relevant considerations have been applied and irrelevant ones discounted and or what the real purpose the discretion was used for (especially in light of the complete lack of transparency and potential dangerousness of delegation of sovereign powers hidden within wording of discrete secondary legislation).

Whether there are concerns of irrationality- namely the decision to sponsor and delegate such a decision to WHA ‚Äì namely is it Wednesbury unreasonable given the far-reaching nature. The principle of proportionality being applicable given the human rights and constitutional issues.

Whether there is potential procedural impropriety- namely failure to comply with (i) constitutional procedures (ii) legitimate expectations re constitutional/ sovereignty issues re delegated decision on regional and intermediate lockdowns etc to Director-General (DG) of WHO (iii) general duty to act fairly ‚Äì natural justice and justice being seen to be done.

Whether such amendments with far-reaching consequences should be subject to public consultation and parliamentary scrutiny.

Whether it is appropriate to remove the proposed amendments from being a WHA agenda item at 75th WHA May 2022.

Whether the WHO can be deemed an organisation suitable to be given sovereign powers by virtue of the proposed amendments (especially in view of the controversial private funded nature of the organisation since 2005 including Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (a larger contribution than even the United States government) and also include donors who profit from lockdown measure such as AstraZeneca, Bayer, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and Merck.).

Request for Information

Name and contact details for the 75th WHA UK delegate. Date of any Parliamentary debates relating to the proposed amendments to IHR Date of any publication with explanations to the general public of UK regarding the proposed amendments Any information/ debate details regarding proposed national legislation to incorporate the proposed amendments should they be adopted at 75th WHA. Date and reasons for sponsorship by UK of the proposed amendments with details of considerations of transparency and public awareness of proposed delegated powers and their effect. My Client relies on information regarding the 75th WHA that is researchable following the announcement of the proposed ‚Äúpandemic Treaty‚Äù (Pandemic prevention, preparedness and response). However, if there is information that the Government is aware of that would otherwise undermine the justification for inclusion of the proposed amendments to IHR to be considered and adopted at 75th WHA (as per the Provisional Agenda item 16.2 dated 12th April 2022), such as: The latest information as to WHA agenda items and proposed IHR amendments or otherwise information regarding delegation of powers to WHO; Information as to all WHA delegates and invitees/attendees; The latest information regarding harmful effect of lockdown measures; The latest information regarding the ineffectiveness of lockdown measures in respect of spread of covid-19 to include vaccines, masks, social distancing and testing; The latest information regarding the disproportionate impact of lockdown measures on certain groups and individuals and to include children and, for example, ethnic minorities and others grouped by protected characteristics; The latest information on the harm and effectiveness of travel and trade restrictions; Guidance as to procedure for constitutional change/ matters of sovereignty and delegation of the same powers and procedures. Information received from the ONS, JCVI, MHRA or other advisory or regulatory bodies that discloses concern as to the safety and effectiveness of any of the vaccines and whether therefore that travel passports and such like are still arguable Information and or advice regarding the effectiveness of the covid-19 vaccines and other lockdown measures in reducing transmission.

My Client is informed by the latest available data and analysis on lockdown measures.

For example,

In the recent report/review published by John Hopkins Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and Study of Business Enterprise, Jonas Herby, Lars Jonung, and Steve H. Hanke concluded that an analysis of each of these three groups support the conclusion that lockdowns have had little to no effect on COVID-19 mortality. More specifically, stringency index studies find that lockdowns in Europe and the United States only reduced COVID-19 mortality by 0.2% on average.

https://www.express.co.uk/comment/columnists/frederick-forsyth/1564221/‚Ä¶.

It would be helpful to understand government‚Äôs position so that action can be considered within the tight Judicial Review timescales and given the pending 75th WHA due to start on 22nd May 2022, and you are therefore asked to provide written confirmation of the following by 5pm on Friday 13th May 2022:

The fact that a review with the above information has been carried out and the outcome and reasons and/or reasons for failure to review; The name and contact details for the UK delegate for the 75th WHA 2022 expected to deal with the proposed amendments to the IHR together with a list of delegates for the other 193 MS; Answers to requests for information (1) ‚Äì (6) inc. above.

Potential proposed action

Should a satisfactory response not be received, and should an acceptable outcome not be reached by 5pm 13th May 2022, it is anticipated that one or more of the following actions (but not limited to the same) will be taken (whether by an individual application or proposed group standing action) in seeking to protect fundamental constitutional rights:

Pre-action protocol JR letter before claim (if timing allows);

Emergency JR application seeking an injunction prohibiting the proposed amendments to remain on the 75th WHA Agenda; and/or prohibiting UK Sponsorship to continue pre transparency eg parliamentary scrutiny and public consultation;

JR request for a declaration: ultra vires and or Wednesbury unreasonable and or procedurally improper;

JR request for a mandatory order that such far reaching amendments have to be subject to transparency, public consultation and parliamentary scrutiny/ order prohibiting inclusion of the proposed amendments on the WHA agenda.

You will appreciate that time is of the essence in this matter and as such we look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible and within 7 days at the latest (5pm 13th May 2022).

Please note that my Client intends to make this letter public because he considers it to be an urgent matter of the utmost public importance.

Yours faithfully

Dr Cox‚Äôs letter is one of the most important documents since Magna Carta. It is vital for our future that the Government is forced to reply. There have been a good many pointless legal challenges in the last two years. But this one is crucial.

If governments have their way we will soon be slaves ‚Äì forced, without the option, to follow orders from the dangerous people at the World Health Organisation who have, for the last two years, appeared to follow instructions from the evil conspirators eager to take over the world.

36,https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-06-09-gunman-attempts-murder-kavanaugh-roe-wade-abortion.html#,"(Natural News) A man brandishing a weapon has been taken into custody after he was allegedly caught trying to murder Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh over the high court‚Äôs leaked opinion on overturning Roe v. Wade.

The man had been making threats against Kavanaugh before appearing near the justice‚Äôs Maryland home, according to federal and local officials. (Related: Planned Parenthood supporters and other violent leftists have also pledged to murder the Supreme Court if abortion does not remain federally legal.)

The Washington Post says the man is from California and in his mid-20s. People familiar with the investigation claim that the man told police officers that he wanted to kill Kavanaugh, prompting them to stop and arrest him on a nearby street.

The man was allegedly carrying a gun, a knife and various burglary tools, according to people familiar with the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Two others, also anonymous, claim that the man was angry about the possible overturning of Roe v. Wade, as well as the recent spate of mass shootings.

Supreme Court spokeswoman Patricia McCabe issued a statement confirming the man‚Äôs arrest, which took place around 1:50 a.m. on June 8. Between the hours of 1:14 and 1:45 a.m., the man is said to have ‚Äúc[o]me in from out of state with the intent to kill Kavanaugh.‚Äù

Why is Roe v. Wade suddenly being overturned at a time like this?

A spokeswoman for the FBI office in Maryland says the entity is ‚Äúaware‚Äù of the arrest and is now ‚Äúworking with our law enforcement partners‚Äù to figure out what to do next, declining to comment any further.

A final decision about Roe v. Wade is expected to come possibly in early June. Enhanced security has been set up around the justices and the court itself, which now has a tall fence encircling the building ‚Äì much like the wall that has been erected around the White House.

It is almost as if the corrupt federal government is blockading itself in anticipation of mass civil unrest, which will be targeted at federal officials over a variety of issues ‚Äì think hyperinflation, economic collapse, food shortages, violence and more.

‚ÄúThreats of violence and actual violence against the justices of course strike at the heart of our democracy,‚Äù stated Attorney General Merrick Garland when asked by the corporate-controlled media about acts and threats of violence against Supreme Court justices.

‚ÄúAnd we will do everything we can to prevent them and to hold people who do them accountable.‚Äù

In his own statement, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, said he was briefed about the incident and decided to push for extra security measures, particularly around the justices‚Äô homes.

‚ÄúI call on leaders in both parties in Washington to strongly condemn these actions in no uncertain terms,‚Äù Hogan said. ‚ÄúIt is vital to our constitutional system that the justices be able to carry out their duties without fear of violence against them and their families.‚Äù

Over at Natural News, one commenter questioned the timing of the Supreme Court‚Äôs supposedly leaked opinion on Roe v. Wade, particularly because it is directly coinciding with the collapse of Western civilization.

‚ÄúThis just seems to me like another deliberate trick of some kind,‚Äù this person wrote. ‚ÄúI mean, they‚Äôre being a little too peaceful about it at this point and this whole thing has me very suspicious.‚Äù

Another wrote that overturning Roe v. Wade will not even do anything, which makes the situation even more suspicious in terms of its true intent.

‚ÄúIt merely reverts to the states,‚Äù this person added about how abortion will still be legal most everywhere at the state level.

This comes after two solid years of Democrats and the liberal media talking about Janury 6th non-stop.

This week, the January 6th Committee is even holding a televised hearing during prime time because apparently, they don‚Äôt think Americans have heard enough about it.

In reality, Democrats and the media are the only people who care about this.

It appears the House‚Äôs Jan. 6 committee has some work to do with the American public as it begins a new round of public hearings this week on its findings.

Just 45 percent of Americans say Donald Trump is ‚Äúsolely‚Äù or ‚Äúmainly‚Äù responsible for the rioters who overtook the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack, versus a combined 55 percent who say the former president is only somewhat responsible or not really responsible, according to results from the latest NBC News poll.

That‚Äôs a shift from the Jan. 2021 NBC poll ‚Äî taken days after the attack ‚Äî when 52 percent said Trump was either solely or mainly responsible, compared with 47 percent who disagreed.

Ukrainian football legend Andriy Shevchenko says President Volodymyr Zelensky is ""unbelievable"" and he is very proud of how his country and its people have been dealing with the war.

Shevchecnko, who played for teams including Dynamo Kyiv, AC Milan and Chelsea, is Ukraine's record goalscorer and also managed the national team at last year's European Championship.

He said on a recent visit to Kyiv he had a ""very nice meeting with the president"", and they were positive they could defend their country and bring peace to Ukraine.

""At the most difficult time in our the history of Ukraine he has brought people together and sent a great message across the world,"" he tells BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Ukraine's people must not give up, we want our democracy we fight for our freedom and that's a massive message to everyone.

""I'm so proud how my country and the people united to stay strong and defend the country.""

This weekend Shevchenko will play in Soccer Aid - an annual football match involving former players and celebrities. It raises money for Unicef and this year the charity says some of the money raised will go towards helping those impacted by the war.

""This event is going to help a lot of people in Ukraine,"" he says, ""especially kids, we're going to create a lot of great programmes to improve a lot of things for kids.""",1
27,https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/09/biden-abortion-00038565,"Yet many Democratic officials and abortion-rights activists fear the party is unlikely to pick up enough seats in the midterms to pass comprehensive abortion-rights legislation. And even if it can, many fear that waiting until a new Congress is seated in January will be too late to prevent the harm they expect if tens of millions of people lose access to abortion.

While Biden has few options to preserve abortion access in states determined to restrict it, there are actions his administration can take to bolster reproductive health rights, including making it easier to obtain abortion medication, protecting patient privacy and making sure more people can afford and access contraception, according to lawmakers and abortion-rights groups.

Earlier this week, 25 senators wrote to Biden pleading with him to drop the remaining FDA restrictions on abortion pills, which include a requirement that any pharmacy that distributes the drug obtain a special license. They also called for travel vouchers and other financial support to people crossing state lines for the procedure, cracking down on the states that are trying to drop Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs, ramping up protections around digital health data that could be used to prosecute people who have abortions, and exploring whether abortions could be offered on federally owned properties even in states that implement bans. Democrats in Congress are also lobbying the Pentagon to allow service members who are stationed in states likely to ban abortion to take leave to travel for the procedure.

Abortion-rights advocates have also called on the Biden administration to issue tougher HIPAA guidance to prevent medical workers from reporting people they suspect of having abortions to law enforcement ‚Äî something that‚Äôs already happening in Texas and other states. They also want stricter enforcement of widespread violations of Obamacare‚Äôs contraception mandate ‚Äî one of several steps they‚Äôre calling for that could help prevent unwanted pregnancies.

White House spokesperson Alexandra LaManna told POLITICO in a statement that the administration is looking at ‚Äúevery possible option‚Äù and ‚Äúbelieves we should defend the right of all Americans to make their own decisions.‚Äù

The White House has repeatedly said it is waiting for a Supreme Court ruling, which could happen as early as next week, before the administration rolls out any response ‚Äî angering Democrats at both the state and federal levels who want to see the Biden take a stronger and more proactive stand.

‚ÄúWe knew this was coming and, nationally, didn‚Äôt have a plan,‚Äù fumed Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) in an interview with POLITICO. ‚ÄúPart of my frustration is with, frankly, some of my own colleagues and peers. The other side for 50 years has had a legal strategy ‚Äî where is our 50-year strategy? As someone who comes from a CIA and Pentagon background, I‚Äôm frankly furious that there wasn‚Äôt more D-Day, decision day, planning.‚Äù

Slotkin chalks up the lack of planning among Democrats and progressive activist groups to a ‚Äúfailure of imagination‚Äù and a misguided assumption that Roe, which has held for nearly 50 years, was untouchable.

‚ÄúWhere was the legislation to undergird Roe back when we had a large majority in the Senate and a decent majority in the House?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of frustration, and now we need to turn that frustration into a damn plan.‚Äù",1

A team of scientists convened by the World Health Organization to better understand the origins of the coronavirus pandemic and possible future outbreaks has said a theory that the virus could have escaped from a laboratory needs ‚Äúfurther investigations.‚Äù Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight However, in a report released Thursday, the WHO-backed team said it had not received any new data that would allow it to better evaluate that theory.

Members of the group from Brazil, China and Russia objected to the calls for further investigation into the ‚Äúlab leak‚Äù theory.

The report also said that available data suggests SARS-CoV-2 had a zoonotic origin, which means it spread between animals in a natural setting, but that neither the animal that infected humans nor the place where this infection occurred could be identified.

‚ÄúAt this point, the strongest evidence is still around zoonotic transmission,‚Äù Marietjie Venter, chair of the WHO team and a virologist at the University of Pretoria in South Africa, said in a Zoom call with reporters before the report was published. ‚ÄúHowever, the precursor viruses that have been identified in bats are definitely not close enough to be the virus that spilled over into humans.‚Äù

The report was written by the Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO), a body made up of experts from the United States, China and 25 other nations that first came together last year after widespread criticism of a joint WHO-China investigation into the coronavirus‚Äôs origins.

WHO officials emphasized that the report contains only the preliminary findings of the group, which was created to advise the global health body‚Äôs secretariat. SAGO did not undertake its own studies, but instead reviewed existing research.

The team is designed not only to help investigate the origins of the coronavirus but also to set up a framework for understanding the origins of future outbreaks. Its work is expected to last for years, WHO officials said.

‚ÄúIt is just the start,‚Äù Maria Van Kerkhove, a World Health Organization epidemiologist, told reporters. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve made some good progress. They‚Äôve clearly outlined that there‚Äôs more work to be done.‚Äù

Even so, the report may breathe life into a debate that has never come to a firm conclusion: Where did the coronavirus pandemic come from? While many scientists have favored a theory of zoonotic spread, the lab-leak theory has gained prominent support from some experts, including some U.S. officials.

Beijing has fiercely rejected the idea that the coronavirus could have escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology or another research institute studying coronaviruses in the Chinese city where covid-19 was first recorded in late 2019.

In its place, Chinese officials promoted wild theories without scientific backing, including that the virus originated in the United States or was imported to China on frozen fish.

The SAGO report aimed to evaluate pandemic origins from a scientific stance, Van Kerkhove said. ‚ÄúWe are under no illusions that we can keep all of the politics out, but we will do our damnedest to keep focused on what needs to be done here.‚Äù

Advertisement

The preliminary SAGO report was released more than a year after the joint WHO-China team traveled to Wuhan and released its own report that ruled out the lab-leak theory as ‚Äúextremely unlikely,‚Äù while suggesting that the idea the virus was carried by frozen food needed further investigation.

The WHO-China report concluded that zoonotic spread was the likeliest scenario for the origin of the virus, but failed to find evidence for how it was spread to humans.

That report was widely criticized after being released in March 2021, with WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus suggesting that the report did not conduct an ‚Äúextensive enough‚Äù assessment of the lab-leak theory and voicing frustration with the low level of access given to the mission by Chinese officials.

One of the researchers on the joint team, Danish food scientist Peter Ben Embarek, later told interviewers that Chinese researchers on the team had pushed back against including the lab-leak theory in the report at all.

While SAGO was convened to address some of the criticism of the WHO-China report, it also was able to evaluate some new evidence, including data on blood samples from 40,000 Chinese donors in Wuhan between September and December 2019.

According to the report, more than 200 of these samples initially tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, but these were later found to be false positives. SAGO requested further information on the data and methods used to analyze the samples.

The new report suffers from some of the same limitations as the joint WHO-China report ‚Äî including that Chinese officials cannot be compelled to cooperate with any investigation.

According to the SAGO report, Tedros sent letters to Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Health Minister Ma Xiaowei on Feb. 14 and Feb. 21, respectively, requesting information on a variety of factors, including the ‚Äúlaboratory hypotheses.‚Äù

It is not clear whether Tedros received a reply. Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesperson for the WHO, said the body doesn‚Äôt share correspondence it has with member states.

Venter, the SAGO chair, said Chinese officials had cooperated with the team, sending experts to present and discuss new findings.

‚ÄúWe recognize that they‚Äôve done a huge amount of work and they have addressed several of the questions‚Äù raised in the initial WHO-China report, Venter said.

However, SAGO found that much had not been addressed. Venter identified the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan as one location that needed more study. ‚ÄúWe recognize that the market ... may have been an amplification event of the early outbreak, but it‚Äôs not clear where all those animals came from. We need to follow up on that,‚Äù she said.

Scientists have found microplastics in fresh Antarctic snow for the first time, in a study they say highlights ‚Äúthe extent of plastic pollution globally.‚Äù Researchers at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand collected snow samples from 19 sites in Antarctica, and all contained the tiny plastics, according to the peer-reviewed paper published this week in the journal Cryosphere.

The research revealed an average of 29 microplastic particles per liter of melted snow. Of the 13 types of plastics, the most common was polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which is used to manufacture clothes and soda bottles.

When PhD student Alex Aves went to Antarctica to collect the samples in 2019, ‚Äúwe were optimistic that she wouldn‚Äôt find any microplastics in such a pristine and remote location,‚Äù associate professor Laura Revell said Wednesday in a statement. Still, she added, ‚Äúfrom the studies published in the last few years, we‚Äôve learned that everywhere we look for airborne microplastics, we find them.‚Äù

The minuscule plastic particles, which can come from artificial clothing fibers, broken-down consumer products and other sources, are mostly undetectable to the naked eye ‚Äî ‚Äúmuch smaller than a grain of rice,‚Äù as this study describes them.

But from deep oceans to Mount Everest, they have become nearly ubiquitous in a world that generates billions of pounds of plastic waste every year. People can also ingest them in water and food, although their effect on human health is not yet clear.

While prior research has identified the tiny particles in Antarctic sea sediments and surface water, the New Zealand study marks the first time they have been reported in fresh snow, according to the scientists.

The most likely origins of the airborne microplastics are local research stations, from clothing or equipment, although the results also suggest that the particles may have traveled through the air from sources more than 3,700 miles away, they said.

Noting a ‚Äúgrowing threat to the Antarctic ecosystem,‚Äù the study said microplastics can lead to impaired biological and reproductive functions in exposed organisms, from krill to penguins. It also makes reference to previous findings that the particles deposited on snow or ice caps can speed up melting, in part by absorbing light.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs incredibly sad,‚Äù said Aves, the researcher, ‚Äúbut finding microplastics in fresh Antarctic snow highlights the extent of plastic pollution into even the most remote regions of the world.‚Äù

Democrats are desperate to preemptively cope with or deny their upcoming crushing defeat.

At 72, and having spent a career inside circles of power, Hunt is not exactly the target demographic for the Notorious RBG gear that became ubiquitous during Ginsburg‚Äôs late-life emergence as an unlikely Millennial meme machine. But over the years, she wound up with a couple of mugs depicting the champion of women‚Äôs rights, who died in 2020.

Recently, though, Hunt decided she didn‚Äôt want to see them. With the Supreme Court poised to reverse Roe v Wade, Ginsburg‚Äôs decision not to step down during the Obama administration looms large in the estimations of some of her admirers, who see it as enabling the destruction of large parts of Ginsburg‚Äôs legacy. The unintended ‚Äî but not unforeseeable ‚Äî result was that Donald Trump was able to name Ginsburg‚Äôs successor, who may wind up as the fifth vote to overturn the landmark 1973 abortion-rights ruling.

‚ÄúWhat I wanted to do was pack it away. I thought, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want to look at it,‚Äô‚Äù Hunt says. ‚ÄúI want to put it away for my children and my grandchildren. That took work. I‚Äôm 72, and if there‚Äôs something that grieves me, I want to get it out of my life. I didn‚Äôt want to see it again. It was too painful. I felt betrayed.‚Äù

That constellation of emotions has been increasingly common since POLITICO‚Äôs report last month of a draft opinion reversing Roe. Much of the wistfulness is felt not by disappointed idealist purchasers of lace-collar Halloween costumes or RBG refrigerator magnets, but by people who might have been the justice‚Äôs peers ‚Äî people well established in law, politics and public service, many of whom can empathize with the complicated feelings involved in calling it quits.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs certainly hard for me, now, to think of her work and of her ‚Äî and not to, these days, work up a degree of regret and anger,‚Äù says Dorothy Samuels, who authored The New York Times‚Äô legal editorials during her 30 years on the paper‚Äôs editorial board. ‚ÄúThis is so multilayered because she cared so passionately about advancing equality for everybody. She figured out a way to get women to be part of the constitution. And yet, what she has helped to give us is a court that for a long, long time is going to be undoing the equality rulings that she was part of.‚Äù

Samuels heard the same thing from former clerks and other inner-circle members while researching a book in the years before Ginsburg‚Äôs death. ‚ÄúIt was an extraordinarily self-centered thing to do.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe gambled,‚Äù says Michele Dauber, the outspoken Stanford law professor, speaking of Ginsburg‚Äôs apparent calculation that Hillary Clinton would be in the White House to appoint her successor. ‚ÄúBut she didn‚Äôt just gamble with herself. She gambled with the rights of my daughter and my granddaughter. And unfortunately, that‚Äôs her legacy. I think it‚Äôs tragic.‚Äù

Anyone looking to hide from Ginsburg‚Äôs image will have a hard time. Nearly two years after her death, the capital, and the country, remain awash in Ginsburgiana: Murals in New York, San Antonio, Kansas City, Denver, Baltimore, San Jose and beyond; a U.S. Navy ship; a New York hospital; a new species of praying mantis. According to data from Bookscan, sales of Irin Carmon and Shana Knizhnik‚Äôs Notorious RBG ‚Äî the ur-text of Ginsburg‚Äôs transformation from jurist to secular saint ‚Äî appear unaffected by the draft-ruling bombshell.

Ditto the ubiquitous RBG merch. ‚ÄúWe still carry a bunch of stuff with her image on it,‚Äù says Bradley Graham, who owns Washington‚Äôs Politics & Prose bookstore. ‚ÄúA cup, a doll, a candle. The sales on these kind of ebb and flow, but we haven‚Äôt detected any particular falloff. We‚Äôre still carrying them and still selling some. We just hear from some people that they‚Äôre mad at her.‚Äù

The connection between Ginsburg‚Äôs status as a pop-culture phenomenon and the choices she made about retirement, in fact, have become part of the posthumous finger-pointing. Was the cult of RBG one of the factors that propelled her to stick around instead of retiring at a politically safe moment?

‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard, before her death and after, the argument that, ‚ÄòWhy have you people made her this demigod?‚Äô‚Äù says Debbie Levy, the Washington-based author of two largely laudatory children‚Äôs books about Ginsburg. ‚ÄúI say, maybe somebody made her a demigod, I didn‚Äôt make her a demigod. I view her, I still view her, as a great person. This idea that if by elevating her as an example, we‚Äôve done this disservice. I would say, disservice to whom?‚Äù

The timeline also doesn‚Äôt quite work. Carmon and Knizhnik‚Äôs book only came out in 2015 ‚Äî while Obama was still president, but after the Democrats had lost the Senate. The Tumblr on which it was based launched in 2013. But the first calls for Ginsburg to retire for safe-replacement reasons came before the 2012 elections, by which point the justice had already gone through bouts of colon and pancreatic cancer. Those early calls for retirement were met with Ginsburg‚Äôs very same, characteristically stubborn, refusal to heed people telling her to get out.

Still, Ginsburg‚Äôs singular cultural status today adds a certain potency to the portions of the draft opinion where Justice Samuel Alito cites Ginsburg‚Äôs own publicly stated disagreements with Roe v. Wade (she had issues with aspects of the judicial and political approach, not the result). The asides enraged Ginsburg admirers, but also point to something that the justice‚Äôs feminist critics have noted in recent weeks: that the focus on RBG obscures scores of other movement colleagues ‚Äî including ones who may have had the better of her in certain arguments.

‚ÄúShe was very smart and very clever and very energetic, but she wasn‚Äôt the only game in town,‚Äù says Linda Hirshman, the lawyer and author of a dual biography of Ginsburg and Sandra Day O‚ÄôConnor.

Another thing the societal ardor for Ginsburg has done is make criticism of her choices more fraught. In 2014, Erwin Chemerinsky, now the dean at the University of California‚Äôs law school, wrote a POLITICO column urging her to step down. ‚ÄúI received a very angry response, including indirectly (through others) from Justice Ginsburg,‚Äù he told me by email. Same with Dauber, who sent a number of caustic tweets about ‚ÄúRBG cult members‚Äù and the legacy of her choice to stay.

‚ÄúHer clerks, women law professors, and women in society in general really felt that she is above criticism,‚Äù she says.

The fact is, people looking to cast blame for the rollback of abortion rights have a pretty long list of culprits before getting to Ginsburg: The justices who may write the decision, the presidents who appointed them, the GOP Senate that blocked Barack Obama‚Äôs third judicial nomination, the Democrats who didn‚Äôt pass a national abortion-rights bill when they had large majorities, the filibuster, the electoral college and on and on. You could even cite another judicial retirement decision: In 1991, Thurgood Marshall stepped down, declaring himself ‚Äúold and falling apart.‚Äù Marshall wound up living until four days after Bill Clinton‚Äôs inauguration ‚Äî meaning that if he‚Äôd somehow stayed put, Clarence Thomas might never have joined the Court to eventually vote down Roe.

‚ÄúI find it very hard to find fault with Ruth Bader Ginsburg for any kind of sin against the women‚Äôs movement,‚Äù says Susan Estrich, the lawyer and longtime Democratic insider. ‚ÄúWhat we need to recognize is that she was there for all those years, not that she unfortunately succumbed to illness before she planned.‚Äù

‚ÄúBefore Ruth Ginsburg was ever on the court, she was an advocate who helped teach America about the meaning of equal protection and of gender justice,‚Äù says Reva Siegel, a Yale law professor who says her office contains a depiction of Ginsburg accompanied by the words ‚Äúmay her memory be a revolution.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnother way we can understand her legacy is to look outside of the United States Supreme Court today and see the future of reproductive justice growing in state legislatures and in state courts and in the streets where a new generation of Americans is going to give new constitutional expression to liberty and equality.‚Äù

To Hirshman, whose coverage of Ginsburg was generally but not uniformly positive, the bigger issue than one person‚Äôs unwise choice is her view of why Ginsburg made the decision ‚Äî a factor that‚Äôs relevant to all sorts of Washington players these days: Ginsburg‚Äôs age. Hirshman, who is 78, believes the justice had lost her ‚Äúconnection to the existing zeitgeist‚Äù in the country. Someone more in touch, she says, would have had a clearer understanding of the radicalism of her opponents and their willingness not to abide by old norms.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very difficult question ‚Äî should people be braying about how it‚Äôs all Ruth Bader Ginsburg‚Äôs fault?‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe more interesting question is, how did we get to this point where all of these old people are making these decisions? I‚Äôm not saying that only having people in their 50s and 60s guarantees a good outcome. I‚Äôm just saying it raises the odds‚Ä¶.You really don‚Äôt want to gamble with the fate of the most powerful democratic republic in the world.‚Äù

In retrospect, Hirshman says, taking a gamble against actuarial odds will lead to undoing much of Ginsburg‚Äôs work. Not taking that bet, in other words, could have helped preserve that legacy: ‚ÄúRetiring might have made her more important than every decision she wrote on the Supreme Court.‚Äù",0

Still, she added, ‚Äúfrom the studies published in the last few years, we‚Äôve learned that everywhere we look for airborne microplastics, we find them.‚Äù

The minuscule plastic particles, which can come from artificial clothing fibers, broken-down consumer products and other sources, are mostly undetectable to the naked eye ‚Äî ‚Äúmuch smaller than a grain of rice,‚Äù as this study describes them.

But from deep oceans to Mount Everest, they have become nearly ubiquitous in a world that generates billions of pounds of plastic waste every year. People can also ingest them in water and food, although their effect on human health is not yet clear.

While prior research has identified the tiny particles in Antarctic sea sediments and surface water, the New Zealand study marks the first time they have been reported in fresh snow, according to the scientists.

The most likely origins of the airborne microplastics are local research stations, from clothing or equipment, although the results also suggest that the particles may have traveled through the air from sources more than 3,700 miles away, they said.

Noting a ‚Äúgrowing threat to the Antarctic ecosystem,‚Äù the study said microplastics can lead to impaired biological and reproductive functions in exposed organisms, from krill to penguins. It also makes reference to previous findings that the particles deposited on snow or ice caps can speed up melting, in part by absorbing light.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs incredibly sad,‚Äù said Aves, the researcher, ‚Äúbut finding microplastics in fresh Antarctic snow highlights the extent of plastic pollution into even the most remote regions of the world.‚Äù

28,https://www.politico.com/sponsored-content/2022/05/seizing-the-next-revolution?utm_source=native&utm_medium=hp,"Tech innovation carries the potential to solve some of the world's most pressing problems, and women have the opportunity to be central to the creation and deployment of the future technologies that will be critical to realizing this promise. But as we accelerate into the metaverse and barrel towards next-generation advancements like Web3, it's critical to proceed with caution. Unless we develop new technologies with inclusivity in mind at the start, we risk a future that will only deepen the disparities that already negatively affect women and other disenfranchised communities, like the digital divide, the gender gap and the STEM gap.

Those were the stakes that informed discussions in late April during Women Rule: The Exchange, which brought together women academics, policymakers and business leaders for a half-day of dialogue in Washington. Participants joined roundtables, listened to experts in public-facing events, and shared their personal experiences, challenges and hopes for the future. But, for all, the message was clear: in order to make progress in innovation, women must advocate for other women, even ‚Äî and especially ‚Äî when those women don't yet have a seat at the table themselves.

Addressing bias

As women rise to take on leadership positions in government and business, they frequently encounter systemic bias and spaces where women's voices haven't historically been a part of the conversation. Take the case of Jessica Rosenworcel, the first woman to be confirmed as the permanent chair of the Federal Communications Commission in the organization's 87-year history. Frequently, she's the only woman in meetings, and says that comes with a sense of responsibility. ‚ÄúIt has trained me to constantly think about who's not present, whose opinion isn't being voiced, what communities might be overlooked or left behind by the decisions we're making,‚Äù Rosenworcel said.

It's that kind of absence that actually inspired a business idea for entrepreneur Anu Duggal, who experienced firsthand the challenge of accessing venture capital funding, which predominantly goes to companies led by men. In fact, in 2021, only 2 percent of VC dollars went to companies founded by women, according to PitchBook ‚Äî and that's an 83 percent improvement from 2020. Seeking to change that, Duggal launched Female Founders Fund in 2014 to invest exclusively in enterprises founded by women. Quickly, she learned she was not exempt from bias: she coordinated more than 700 meetings over two years to raise an initial $6 million. ‚ÄúIt took a lot of resilience,‚Äù she said. Today, the fund manages more than $700 million and is one of many firms focused on women. ‚ÄúSo, the world has definitely evolved,‚Äù said Duggal, ‚Äúbut there's still a long way to go.‚Äù

Getting connected

The disparities in access run deep for women and start early in women's careers. Not only are they less likely to pursue jobs in tech-related fields, they're less likely to even have access to technology. Globally, just 30 percent of STEM workers are women, and 57 percent of women use the internet compared to 62 percent of men, according to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). In the U.S., both the private sector and the government are addressing the problem by expanding access to broadband.

During Covid-19, the importance of internet access became abundantly clear as schools, workplaces, government and health care went remote. Kathy Grillo, Verizon's senior vice president, public policy and government affairs, says that Verizon has focused on ways to make services more accessible and affordable to all to help close that gap. ‚ÄúWhat we've tried to focus on is how do we get our product out to as many people as possible?‚Äù says Grillo. To help achieve that goal, Verizon offers free high-speed broadband service to participants in the FCC's Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) who subscribe to Fios.

At the FCC, prior to the pandemic, Rosenworcel had already been working to address something called the ‚Äúhomework gap,‚Äù which refers to as many as 17 million students in the U.S. who have internet access in school but not at home. Covid-19 exacerbated that need. Working with Congress, the FCC helped set up a $7 billion fund to get more than 12.5 million kids connected. ‚ÄúEvery one of us needs a broadband connection to have a fair shot at 21st-century success,‚Äù said Rosenworcel. ‚ÄúAnd the more people we get connected, the more women we get connected, I think the more creative our economy and vibrant our culture will be.‚Äù

A diverse workforce drives good business

When women are missing from decision-making positions in the workplace, the results affect consumers, especially women consumers. Consider the recent changes around crash test dummies. Safety tests performed in cars use dummies shaped like the average man from the 1970s, and those dummies do not account for differences between men's and women's bodies. In February, more than 60 members of Congress urged Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to advocate for the use of female crash test dummies in vehicle safety tests.

Participants also shared examples of how their companies are working to elevate women's voices in leadership and how that will benefit consumers. Grillo said that at Verizon, a broader representation leads to better business decisions. ‚ÄúHaving a lot of women in leadership positions means that we build our products, we think about our services and how our networks run with respect to men and women and everyone,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúIt's important to offer women the opportunities to learn, grow and advance, and be visible in leadership roles,‚Äù said Roshan Roeder, Northrop Grumman's vice president and general manager, airborne multifunction sensors. ‚ÄúOur company is led by women, including Kathy Warden our CEO, and we have multiple women on our board of directors. We host networking at women‚Äôs conferences, promote mentoring programs and create areas for innovation like maker spaces,‚Äù she said.

Not all organizations are able to make strides for women in tech at the pace necessary for substantial change. For that, government leadership could be instrumental, said Elaine Chao, former U.S. Secretary of Transportation and former U.S. Secretary of Labor. Government plays a powerful role as a convener, said Chao, and can establish advisory committees of experts who conduct research and propose solutions as to why women are underrepresented in certain fields.

Making new inroads

At the heart of innovation is its ability to shake up old systems and establish new frameworks. That's been the case with investors in cryptocurrency, the majority of whom are black and Latino, said Cleve Mesidor, executive director of the Blockchain Foundation. And yet, even there, gender disparities remain: men are twice as likely as women to invest in crypto.

Recently, celebrities including Reese Witherspoon, Gwyneth Paltrow and Mila Kunis have encouraged women to invest in cryptocurrency. Mesidor said that's a positive step, but she wants women across all racial and socioeconomic demographics to be able to see themselves working in the industry. In that vein, she's frequently correcting misconceptions about the barriers to entry in blockchain technology careers. She likes to tell women that if they can master Excel, they can master AI, and find a path to high-earning jobs. ‚ÄúYou can get a certificate program today in AI, in cybersecurity, in VR and get a job making $75,000 in six months,‚Äù she said.

At its best, innovation in tech is driven by optimism and the desire to solve problems for consumers. Just as each generation of technology improves on the last, we can hope for the same for each generation of humans, as we learn from past errors and omissions. As we work towards that future, Rosenworcel reiterated how important it is for women to help one another so that we can all move forward together.

‚ÄúThe advice that I always pass along is something that [the first African-American Congresswoman] Shirley Chisholm once said, which is, 'If they don't give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair.‚Äô‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúPeople won't always make space for you. So you're going to have to make a space for yourself. And when you succeed in doing that, be someone who brings someone else along.‚Äù",1

Inflation in May reached a new pandemic-era peak of 8.6 percent compared with a year earlier, with soaring energy, housing and food prices driving up costs at the fastest pace in 40 years. Compared with April, May prices rose 1 percent, according to the latest snapshot issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and known as the consumer price index. The brutal report surprised economists and makes clear just how inescapable inflation has become for millions of American households, dealing with higher rent, bigger gas bills, and rising grocery costs.

‚ÄúWhatever Washington has done to try to fix the cost of living crisis in America, it isn‚Äôt working,‚Äù Chris Rupkey, the chief economist at the research firm FWDBonds, said in an analyst note. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt just Russia and Ukraine anymore.‚Äù

Stocks fell sharply on the unexpectedly high inflation report. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 880 points, or 2.7 percent. The S&P 500 shed 2.9 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index sank 3.5 percent.

The stunning run-up in gas prices has become one of the most visceral ways people feel inflation in their daily lives. As of Friday morning, the national average for a gallon of gas was $4.99, according to AAA.

Inflation continues to deliver major economic and political consequences in the United States, with companies absorbing rising costs, consumers depleting savings and Democrats fretting about fallout in the upcoming November elections. There were hopes in Washington that inflation might ease this summer, but Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine in February pushed energy prices up sharply, and global leaders are scrambling to manage the fallout.

Gas and other energy prices were not the sole drivers of May‚Äôs bleak inflation report. Categories for shelter, airfare, used cars and trucks, and new vehicles were among the largest contributors. The cost of medical care, household furnishings and clothing also rose.

The food index increased 10.1 percent for the 12 months ending in May, the first double-digit increase since 1981. Measures for dairy and related products rose 2.9 percent in May, compared with April, their largest monthly increase since July 2007. Meats, poultry, fish and eggs rose 1.1 percent over the month, with the index for eggs rising 5.0 percent.

In Charlotte, rising food and fuel costs have hit Zada Jane‚Äôs Corner Cafe. Any menu items with chicken have been marked up $2.50 or $3, general manager Courtney Varnum said. Their own suppliers are slapping fuel surcharges on deliveries and requiring that orders be large enough to make the cost of transportation worthwhile. The only cost that has fallen is labor: The brunch spot employed around 40 workers pre-pandemic but is down to 19.

Varnum said loyal customers so far understand why the restaurant has had to raise prices. But she wonders how long that will last.

‚ÄúAre people going to keep going out to eat? And gas prices ‚Äî are people going to keep driving places?‚Äù Varnum asked.

The index for airline fares continued to rise, increasing 12.6 percent in May after rising 18.6 percent the previous month. The index for used cars and trucks rose 1.8 percent in May after declining in each of the three prior months.

Rent rose 0.6 percent in May compared with April in the latest sign of a housing market that has become increasingly unequal. Shelter accounts for about one-third of the basket of goods and services used to measure the consumer price index.

Policymakers are especially concerned that if housing costs don‚Äôt come down, it will be that much harder for overall inflation to return to more normal levels. Months of tough inflation reports have put pressure on the Biden administration and Federal Reserve to stabilize prices.

‚ÄúI think 8.3, 8.5, 8.6 percent are all roughly the same number,‚Äù said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former head of the Congressional Budget Office and the president of the conservative American Action Forum. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre looking at is sustained high inflation that we need to control.‚Äù

The Biden administration has declared inflation its top economic priority and has taken steps to lower prices at the pump, by tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and allowing blended biofuels to be sold. President Biden has largely blamed the surge on the Russian invasion in Ukraine, dubbing it ‚ÄúPutin‚Äôs price hike‚Äù that is spilling over into sectors beyond energy and food, namely airfares.

In a statement Friday, Biden called on Congress to pass legislation that would lower costs for energy bills, shipping costs and prescriptions drugs, and warned the oil industry from capitalizing on high gas prices to rake in excessive profits.

‚ÄúToday‚Äôs report underscores why I have made fighting inflation my top economic priority,‚Äù the statement read. ‚ÄúEven as we continue our work to defend freedom in Ukraine, we must do more ‚Äî and quickly ‚Äî to get prices down here in the United States.‚Äù

For everyday drivers, gas prices, in particular, are acting as a kind of billboard for the rising cost of living.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in uncharted territory,‚Äù said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. He added that ‚Äúit‚Äôs not something that‚Äôs going to turn around anytime soon, I‚Äôm afraid.‚Äù

While inflation has weighed on all households, higher prices have dealt a particularly tough blow to lower-income families, many of whom have exhausted safety nets and cushions built up from last year‚Äôs stimulus programs.

In Chicago, the number of people served by Lincoln Park Community Services, a homeless shelter, has jumped from 422 individuals last year to 1,400 so far this year, as the cost of groceries, gas and rent has soared. Chief executive Cheryl Hamilton-Hill said food costs at the nonprofit have doubled since last year.

Organization leaders are having to rethink how often they can afford to serve meat and fresh produce. Hamilton-Hill knows that some people in need of food have been visiting grocery stores when they put out samples or go by restaurants after they discard unused food for the day.

She‚Äôs seeing the toll of high gas prices, too. Her own employees are stretched to cover their commutes or outreach in the community as the cost per gallon skyrockets.

‚ÄúThis morning when I was driving to work, I think the sign said $8.02,‚Äù Hamilton-Hill said.

Most Americans expect inflation to get worse in the next year and are adjusting their spending habits in response to rising prices, according to a poll conducted by The Washington Post and George Mason University‚Äôs Schar School of Policy and Government. On Friday, a closely watched consumer sentiment survey from the University of Michigan also showed a jump in people‚Äôs inflation expectations over the long term.

That kind of psychological toll is one of the reasons inflation has become a major political threat to Biden and congressional Democrats going into the midterms this year.

Friday‚Äôs data also comes amid growing fears of stunted economic growth worldwide. On Tuesday, the World Bank slashed its annual global growth forecast to 2.9 percent, from January‚Äôs 4.1 percent, and warned that the global economy may suffer from 1970s-style stagflation, a dangerous combination of weak growth and rising prices. And on Thursday, the European Central Bank announced it will raise interest rates at its July meeting by a quarter of a percentage point in its fight against inflation.

Much depends on whether the Federal Reserve manages to cool down the economy without acting so forcefully that it causes a recession. The Fed is on a path to raising interest rates seven times this year and will enact the third of those hikes next week. It is expected to raise rates by half a percentage point, similar to its May meeting, signaling aggressive moves are needed to keep inflation from becoming more persistent and entrenched in the economy.

Advertisement

‚ÄúInflation will come down from this pace on its own,‚Äù said Jason Furman, an economics professor at Harvard University who served as an adviser during the Obama administration. ‚ÄúIt is just is a question of how much it will come down.‚Äù

There are a few encouraging signs in the economy. The red-hot housing market is also starting to cool, as a run-up in mortgage rates discourages aspiring buyers from competing for the few homes available.

There are also limits to what the Fed can do to curb rising prices. Interest rate hikes cannot boost oil supply, bring more people into the labor market or end a war. Energy prices around the world have been rising for months, a reflection of the continuing ripple effects from Russia‚Äôs ongoing war in Ukraine.

And though the Fed is in charge of controlling inflation, rising prices have soured Biden‚Äôs approval ratings for months and the White House has struggled to convince Americans that the economy is working for them.

At the same time inflation is so high, the labor market is unsustainably hot, with about two job openings for every person looking for work. The Fed‚Äôs goal is that higher interest rates can slow down hiring by making it more expensive for businesses to invest and hire.

In an interview with CNBC last week, Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard made clear the central bank is a long way from seeing progress.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be looking for a consistent string of data on both the strength of demand, the labor market coming into better balance, and of course, importantly, a string of decelerating inflation data to feel more confident,‚Äù she said.

A team of scientists convened by the World Health Organization to better understand the origins of the coronavirus pandemic and possible future outbreaks has said a theory that the virus could have escaped from a laboratory needs ‚Äúfurther investigations.‚Äù Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight However, in a report released Thursday, the WHO-backed team said it had not received any new data that would allow it to better evaluate that theory.

Members of the group from Brazil, China and Russia objected to the calls for further investigation into the ‚Äúlab leak‚Äù theory.

The report also said that available data suggests SARS-CoV-2 had a zoonotic origin, which means it spread between animals in a natural setting, but that neither the animal that infected humans nor the place where this infection occurred could be identified.

‚ÄúAt this point, the strongest evidence is still around zoonotic transmission,‚Äù Marietjie Venter, chair of the WHO team and a virologist at the University of Pretoria in South Africa, said in a Zoom call with reporters before the report was published. ‚ÄúHowever, the precursor viruses that have been identified in bats are definitely not close enough to be the virus that spilled over into humans.‚Äù

The report was written by the Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO), a body made up of experts from the United States, China and 25 other nations that first came together last year after widespread criticism of a joint WHO-China investigation into the coronavirus‚Äôs origins.

WHO officials emphasized that the report contains only the preliminary findings of the group, which was created to advise the global health body‚Äôs secretariat. SAGO did not undertake its own studies, but instead reviewed existing research.

The team is designed not only to help investigate the origins of the coronavirus but also to set up a framework for understanding the origins of future outbreaks. Its work is expected to last for years, WHO officials said.

‚ÄúIt is just the start,‚Äù Maria Van Kerkhove, a World Health Organization epidemiologist, told reporters. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve made some good progress. They‚Äôve clearly outlined that there‚Äôs more work to be done.‚Äù

Even so, the report may breathe life into a debate that has never come to a firm conclusion: Where did the coronavirus pandemic come from? While many scientists have favored a theory of zoonotic spread, the lab-leak theory has gained prominent support from some experts, including some U.S. officials.

Beijing has fiercely rejected the idea that the coronavirus could have escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology or another research institute studying coronaviruses in the Chinese city where covid-19 was first recorded in late 2019.

In its place, Chinese officials promoted wild theories without scientific backing, including that the virus originated in the United States or was imported to China on frozen fish.

The SAGO report aimed to evaluate pandemic origins from a scientific stance, Van Kerkhove said. ‚ÄúWe are under no illusions that we can keep all of the politics out, but we will do our damnedest to keep focused on what needs to be done here.‚Äù

Advertisement

The preliminary SAGO report was released more than a year after the joint WHO-China team traveled to Wuhan and released its own report that ruled out the lab-leak theory as ‚Äúextremely unlikely,‚Äù while suggesting that the idea the virus was carried by frozen food needed further investigation.

The WHO-China report concluded that zoonotic spread was the likeliest scenario for the origin of the virus, but failed to find evidence for how it was spread to humans.

That report was widely criticized after being released in March 2021, with WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus suggesting that the report did not conduct an ‚Äúextensive enough‚Äù assessment of the lab-leak theory and voicing frustration with the low level of access given to the mission by Chinese officials.

One of the researchers on the joint team, Danish food scientist Peter Ben Embarek, later told interviewers that Chinese researchers on the team had pushed back against including the lab-leak theory in the report at all.

While SAGO was convened to address some of the criticism of the WHO-China report, it also was able to evaluate some new evidence, including data on blood samples from 40,000 Chinese donors in Wuhan between September and December 2019.

According to the report, more than 200 of these samples initially tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, but these were later found to be false positives. SAGO requested further information on the data and methods used to analyze the samples.

The new report suffers from some of the same limitations as the joint WHO-China report ‚Äî including that Chinese officials cannot be compelled to cooperate with any investigation.

According to the SAGO report, Tedros sent letters to Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Health Minister Ma Xiaowei on Feb. 14 and Feb. 21, respectively, requesting information on a variety of factors, including the ‚Äúlaboratory hypotheses.‚Äù

It is not clear whether Tedros received a reply. Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesperson for the WHO, said the body doesn‚Äôt share correspondence it has with member states.

Venter, the SAGO chair, said Chinese officials had cooperated with the team, sending experts to present and discuss new findings.

‚ÄúWe recognize that they‚Äôve done a huge amount of work and they have addressed several of the questions‚Äù raised in the initial WHO-China report, Venter said.

However, SAGO found that much had not been addressed. Venter identified the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan as one location that needed more study. ‚ÄúWe recognize that the market ... may have been an amplification event of the early outbreak, but it‚Äôs not clear where all those animals came from. We need to follow up on that,‚Äù she said.

Rather than process and deport illegal immigrants, the Biden regime‚Äôs Department of Homeland Security intends to transport them deeper into the United States and away from the border, according to newly revealed internal documents.

Starting within the next few weeks, Los Angeles will be hit by a wave of relocated migrants awaiting processing. Followed by Albuquerque, Houston, Dallas, and other cities further from the border.

Using federal funds, buses and flights full of illegals will eventually go all over the country to different cities. the Department of Homeland Security have internally referred to this plan as the ‚ÄúAbbott Plan,‚Äù in an attempt to mock Texas Governor Greg Abbott and his sending of illegals to Washington D.C.

Biden‚Äôs far-left DHS has also been refusing to expel the full volume of migrants detained under Title 42 during the month of April. Instead, less than 50% of migrants were removed and the rest will be shipped off deeper into the country under this plan.

To many this may seem as a plan to bypass security and immigration measures and get the illegals to cities across the country without a solid plan in place to track them.

Often times, migrants who are relocated in such a way end up lost in the system, meaning that whether they are cleared for entry as ‚Äúasylum seekers‚Äù or not, their whereabouts within the US can become unknown and they will likely never face deportation or repatriation.

Klarna gives customers the option of when to pay for an item ‚Äî they can pay upfront, pay in installments or delay payment for a certain period of time. Critics say this enables people to buy things they might not necessarily be able to afford, although Klarna says it runs affordability checks to ensure that consumers can pay them back.

In an interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Friday, the Swedish entrepreneur said BNPL is ""superior"" to the credit card model, claiming that the average Klarna user has an outstanding balance of $50, whereas the average credit card user has an outstanding balance of $5,000.

Siemiatkowski went on to say his business is ""extremely recession-proof"" compared with traditional credit card firms. However, the fintech reported a loss of $748 million last year and last month announced that it was laying off around 10% of its 6,500 staff as part of an effort to cut costs.

On top of that, Klarna will soon be competing with Apple in the BNPL sector after the iPhone maker announced this week that it plans to enter the market with a new product called Apple Pay Later.

That puts BNPL players like PayPal, Affirm and Klarna in an awkward spot. The fear is that Apple, a $2 trillion company and the world's second-largest smartphone manufacturer, could draw clients away from such services. Shares of Affirm have sunk 17% so far this week on the news.

The investigation of official statistics done by the GoodSciencing.com team has found that the number of athletes who have died since the beginning of 2021 has risen exponentially to a massive 1,700 percent higher than the monthly average between 1966 and 2004.

Additionally, the current trend for 2022 so far shows this could increase to 4,120 percent if the increased number of deaths continues, with the number of deaths in March alone being three times higher than the previous annual average.

The 2021 total equates to 394 deaths, 14 times higher than the 1966 to 2004 annual average, whereas the January to April total is at 279 deaths, which is 9.96 times higher than the annual average from 1966-2004.

Between 1966 and 2004, the monthly average number of deaths equates to 2.35, however, between January 2021 and April 2022, the monthly average is 42. This is an increase of 1,696 percent.

‚ÄúThe increase was observed during the introduction of an experimental injection that was alleged to protect against COVID-19 disease, but instead caused untold damage to the immune system and cardiovascular problems,‚Äù the paper that was published on Global Research indicated.

The paper included 566 patients who received either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines and showed signs of cardiovascular damage following the second shot. The risk of heart attacks or other severe coronary problems more than doubled months after the vaccines were administered, based on changes in markers of inflammation and cell damage.

Correlation of mRNA and adenoviral shots to deadly brain disease exposed

A French pre-print study on the coronavirus vaccines has likewise suggested a link between the vaccines and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a rare and fatal brain condition.

The research, which can be found on the Research Gate publication website, stated that Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines may have contributed to the emergence of a new type of sporadic CJD which is much more aggressive than the traditional form of the disease.

When the COVID-19 variant‚Äôs spike protein gene information was made into a vaccine as part of mRNA and adenoviral DNA vaccines, the prion region was also incorporated.

‚ÄúAfter a patient takes Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccine, the mRNA is naturally incorporated into the person‚Äôs cells, which then use the mRNA instructions to produce a synthetic spike protein. This tricks the cells into believing that they have been infected so that they create an immunological memory against a component of the coronavirus,‚Äù the paper stated.

For AstraZeneca, which uses an adenoviral vector platform, the DNA of the spike protein is carried into the cell through an adenoviral vector and then into the nucleus, where all human DNA is stored. The DNA is then transcribed into mRNA and made into the spike protein.

Though major health organizations say genetic material from the vaccines isn‚Äôt incorporated into human DNA, mRNA studies conducted on human cells in labs proved that mRNA can be transcribed into DNA and then incorporated into the human genome.

It‚Äôs sad to say, but the biological process of translating mRNA information into proteins is not immune to mistakes. Thus, protein misfolding can occur.

CJD is caused by abnormalities in a protein in the brain called a prion. The naturally occurring proteins are usually harmless, but when they become misfolded, they cause nearby prions to also become misshapen, which could lead to the destruction of brain tissue and eventually death. Its symptoms can be similar to those of other dementia-like brain disorders, such as Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.

The disease is incurable, as once one prion becomes infected, it continues to propagate to other prions. There is no current treatment capable of stopping its progress.

26,https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/10/chesa-boudin-progressive-agenda-california-00038675,"But despite the resounding rejection of Boudin, Tuesday‚Äôs results beyond San Francisco suggest voters are willing to reconsider, but not abandon, how their state handles crime and punishment.

‚ÄúWhat happens in San Francisco says more about San Francisco than even the rest of the Bay, never mind the 40 million people in the rest of California,‚Äù said Ludovic Blain, who heads a progressive fundraising network called California Donor Table, pointing to Attorney General Rob Bonta‚Äôs strong showing.

Restiveness about public safety laid the foundation for Boudin‚Äôs ouster. The district attorney‚Äôs foes poured millions of dollars into the campaign that argued he had undermined public order by refusing to prosecute serious crimes ‚Äî and they enlisted disillusioned former prosecutors from his office to make the case.

The result reverberated far beyond the liberal city. National Republicans were quick to predict broader fallout for Democrats after the San Francisco results rolled in. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) urged the defeat of ‚Äúevery single Soros prosecutor‚Äù ‚Äî a reference to the billionaire George Soros funding district attorney campaigns around the country, including in California ‚Äî and backed a baseless rumor that President Joe Biden might tap Boudin for an administration job. Biden himself said Tuesday‚Äôs elections underscored voters‚Äô desire for elected officials to ‚Äústep up and do something about crime.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt turns out it was a political mistake for the entire Democrat party to spend years coddling criminals. Voters will get another chance to voice their displeasure with Democrats‚Äô pro-crime agenda in November,‚Äù a National Republican Campaign Committee spokesperson, Mike Berg, said in a statement after Boudin‚Äôs defeat.

But while Boudin‚Äôs defeat was interpreted outside of San Francisco as a rebuke of the criminal justice reform movement he embodied, San Francisco Democrats took a more nuanced view: This was about specific grievances with Boudin himself, not a return to harsh sentences and mass incarceration. San Francisco Mayor London Breed, who did not take a position on the race but has publicly clashed with Boudin, told reporters on Wednesday that the outcome ‚Äúdoes not mean that criminal justice reform in San Francisco is going anywhere.‚Äù

Recall leader and former San Francisco Democratic Party head Mary Jung said in a statement after Boudin‚Äôs defeat: ‚ÄúSan Francisco voters are engaged and well-informed. They know that we can have important criminal justice reforms and public safety for all, but that neither was being achieved with Chesa in office.‚Äù

The vote to recall Boudin was far more decisive than the vote to elect him in the first place. Boudin prevailed in 2019 after multiple rounds of San Francisco‚Äôs ranked-choice system, narrowly beating out an incumbent whom Breed had appointed to the open seat shortly before the election. That meant he started without a clear voter mandate, leaving space for well-organized and well-funded moderate foes.

The race assumed national proportions from the start. Boudin‚Äôs backers warned that a successful recall campaign would offer a blueprint for the rest of the country: spend money to fan fears about crime and force left-leaning district attorneys out of office. That model could be especially effective as a spike in violent crime has left much of the public on edge. State legislatures in Pennsylvania and Illinois have already moved to try to allow the recalls of liberal prosecutors.

Yet reformers have counterexamples from which to take heart. Progressive Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner surmounted a challenge last year despite surging homicides and heavy police opposition. Progressive attorney Kimberly Graham advanced on Tuesday in her bid to become the prosecutor for Iowa‚Äôs largest county. And in 2020, Californians voted to preserve an earlier ballot initiative that reduced property crime penalties and allowed earlier parole ‚Äî the types of changes that have become fiercely contested in San Francisco and beyond.

‚ÄúSan Francisco voters are engaged and well-informed. They know that we can have important criminal justice reforms and public safety for all, but that neither was being achieved with Chesa in office.‚Äù San Francisco Democratic Party head Mary Jung

As Boudin was delivering his concession speech, another Bay Area district attorney, Diana Becton, rebuffed a law-enforcement-backed challenge in nearby Contra Costa County after having convicted a former sheriff‚Äôs deputy of assault with a firearm for fatally shooting a suspect while on duty. Reform funders spent heavily to defend her. And Pamela Price, another progressive candidate on Tuesday‚Äôs ballot, carved out a plurality in Alameda County, home to Oakland, and is bound for a runoff.

‚ÄúI am moving away from the singular reliance on incarceration as the solution to everything, and I think what‚Äôs happened in so many places in these types of races, when you have a progressive-minded prosecutor, is people are being asked to make a false choice about what public safety means,‚Äù Becton said in an interview. ‚ÄúWe are in this for the long haul,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúIt is a movement, like the civil rights movement, and there are some leaders who may fall but we continue to rise.‚Äù

Nearly 55 percent of voters statewide ‚Äî and nearly three-quarters of San Francisco voters ‚Äî cast their ballots for Bonta, California‚Äôs progressive attorney general, giving him a comfortable lead that could preview a November win. Sacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert ‚Äî an unaffiliated candidate who spent months trying to link Bonta to Boudin, assailing Bonta for plunging the state into ‚Äúchaos‚Äù ‚Äî is languishing in fourth place. She was far behind Bonta even in her home county of Sacramento.

Voters did rebuke liberal contenders elsewhere: In California‚Äôs Central Valley, San Joaquin District Attorney Tori Verber Salazar, a member of a formal progressive group with Boudin that‚Äôs intended as a counterweight to more traditional prosecutors, was losing to a challenger. Orange County‚Äôs Republican district attorney, Todd Spitzer, crushed a Democratic opponent who had highlighted controversies like allegations that Spitzer had displayed racial bias. Sacramento prosecutor Thien Ho defeated progressive opponent Alana Mathews for Schubert‚Äôs job.

In Los Angeles, where progressive District Attorney George Gasc√≥n also faces the threat of a recall election, billionaire ex-Republican mayoral candidate Rick Caruso vaulted past Democratic Rep. Karen Bass into first place after spending tens of millions of dollars promising to restore a sense of public safety and ‚Äúclean up‚Äù homeless encampments in California‚Äôs largest city. But Caruso didn‚Äôt net enough votes to win outright, as his supporters had hoped. Instead, he will face Bass in a November runoff, which is likely to draw younger and more progressive voters.

And LA‚Äôs Democratic sheriff, who rankled his party by taking a tough line on crime and becoming a fixture on Fox News panels excoriating progressive law enforcement, failed to win a second term outright. Sheriff Alex Villanueva is headed to a runoff, where he will likely face a party-backed challenger.

Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles and an expert in campaign ethics and elections, said Tuesday‚Äôs election shows the limits of tough-on-crime messaging‚Äôs appeal. And she argued it was not a stark dichotomy: Even though Caruso was painted as the conservative, tough-on-crime candidate, Bass herself also took an approach that some felt wasn‚Äôt progressive enough ‚Äî promising to add more police to the streets and declare a homeless emergency on her first day in office, both things that Caruso has also vowed to do.

‚ÄúIn a way, we can read what happened with respect to Caruso and Bass as demonstrating that protecting the public, and being tough on crime isn‚Äôt the number one thing in the public‚Äôs mind,‚Äù Levinson said.

Foes of Gasc√≥n ‚Äî Boudin‚Äôs predecessor and a staunch ally ‚Äî are racing to gather enough signatures to trigger a November recall in Los Angeles. Like Boudin, Gasc√≥n has faced an internal revolt as deputy prosecutors took him to court over directives dramatically easing sentencing. Gasc√≥n has modified some of those orders.

A spokesperson for the Gasc√≥n recall, Tim Lineberger, argued that San Francisco‚Äôs ‚Äúresounding rejection of pro-criminal policies that have been masked as criminal justice reform‚Äù foretold a difficult path for Gasc√≥n. Lineberger also said reformers pointing to positive signs from Tuesday‚Äôs votes were ‚Äúgrasping at straws here because it was a bloodbath for them.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat you did see was a district attorney, who has the same policies as that of Los Angeles, be rejected wholesale by some of the most progressive voters in the country, because they disagree with what he calls reform,‚Äù Lineberger said.

Supporters of Boudin and the movement he embodies point to the unique characteristics of his race: a recall that was an up-or-down test of his record, a city on edge after a pandemic in which homicides and some property crimes initially surged, and a wave of outside spending. But they acknowledge that pervasive public pessimism introduces a genuine challenge.

‚ÄúThere are so many aspects of a heavily funded, low-voter-turnout race where voters weren‚Äôt making a choice but were simply provided an opportunity to vent frustration and fear, that I‚Äôm not sure how much one can really take from that,‚Äù said Miriam Krinsky, the executive director of the organization Fair and Just Prosecution. ‚ÄúI do think we need to grapple with the fact that there is a lot of anxiety out there, that people are worried about crime statistics, and that cannot and should not be ignored ‚Äî but I think the question is how do we make communities safer and stronger.‚Äù

One person with an optimistic take on Tuesday‚Äôs results: Boudin himself. Seemingly unfazed by his defeat, Boudin delivered a fiery speech to a crowd of supporters in San Francisco, leading them in chants of ‚ÄúOur cause is righteous! And we have already won!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have already won because we are part of a national movement that recognizes we can never incarcerate our way out of poverty,‚Äù Boudin said, adding that ‚Äúthe movement that got us elected in 2019 is alive and well.‚Äù",1

27,https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/09/biden-abortion-00038565,"Yet many Democratic officials and abortion-rights activists fear the party is unlikely to pick up enough seats in the midterms to pass comprehensive abortion-rights legislation. And even if it can, many fear that waiting until a new Congress is seated in January will be too late to prevent the harm they expect if tens of millions of people lose access to abortion.

While Biden has few options to preserve abortion access in states determined to restrict it, there are actions his administration can take to bolster reproductive health rights, including making it easier to obtain abortion medication, protecting patient privacy and making sure more people can afford and access contraception, according to lawmakers and abortion-rights groups.

Earlier this week, 25 senators wrote to Biden pleading with him to drop the remaining FDA restrictions on abortion pills, which include a requirement that any pharmacy that distributes the drug obtain a special license. They also called for travel vouchers and other financial support to people crossing state lines for the procedure, cracking down on the states that are trying to drop Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs, ramping up protections around digital health data that could be used to prosecute people who have abortions, and exploring whether abortions could be offered on federally owned properties even in states that implement bans. Democrats in Congress are also lobbying the Pentagon to allow service members who are stationed in states likely to ban abortion to take leave to travel for the procedure.

Abortion-rights advocates have also called on the Biden administration to issue tougher HIPAA guidance to prevent medical workers from reporting people they suspect of having abortions to law enforcement ‚Äî something that‚Äôs already happening in Texas and other states. They also want stricter enforcement of widespread violations of Obamacare‚Äôs contraception mandate ‚Äî one of several steps they‚Äôre calling for that could help prevent unwanted pregnancies.

White House spokesperson Alexandra LaManna told POLITICO in a statement that the administration is looking at ‚Äúevery possible option‚Äù and ‚Äúbelieves we should defend the right of all Americans to make their own decisions.‚Äù

The White House has repeatedly said it is waiting for a Supreme Court ruling, which could happen as early as next week, before the administration rolls out any response ‚Äî angering Democrats at both the state and federal levels who want to see the Biden take a stronger and more proactive stand.

‚ÄúWe knew this was coming and, nationally, didn‚Äôt have a plan,‚Äù fumed Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) in an interview with POLITICO. ‚ÄúPart of my frustration is with, frankly, some of my own colleagues and peers. The other side for 50 years has had a legal strategy ‚Äî where is our 50-year strategy? As someone who comes from a CIA and Pentagon background, I‚Äôm frankly furious that there wasn‚Äôt more D-Day, decision day, planning.‚Äù

Slotkin chalks up the lack of planning among Democrats and progressive activist groups to a ‚Äúfailure of imagination‚Äù and a misguided assumption that Roe, which has held for nearly 50 years, was untouchable.

‚ÄúWhere was the legislation to undergird Roe back when we had a large majority in the Senate and a decent majority in the House?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of frustration, and now we need to turn that frustration into a damn plan.‚Äù",0

King Philippe of Belgium expressed his ‚Äúdeepest regrets‚Äù for abuses committed during the country‚Äôs colonization of the Democratic Republic of Congo on Wednesday, but he did not offer a formal apology. The king made the remarks during his first visit to the central African country since he took the throne in 2013. He also handed back a wooden ceremonial mask brought to Belgium during the colonial period.

‚ÄúThis [colonial] regime was one of unequal relations, unjustifiable in itself, marked by paternalism, discrimination and racism,‚Äù he told the country‚Äôs parliament in Kinshasa, the capital, on Wednesday, Reuters reported. ‚ÄúOn the occasion of my first trip to Congo, right here, in front of the Congolese people and those who still suffer today, I wish to reaffirm my deepest regrets for those wounds of the past.‚Äù

Philippe and his wife, Queen Mathilde, received a warm welcome in Congo, where supporters of the ruling party waved Belgian flags and a banner hanging from parliament celebrated a ‚Äúcommon history,‚Äù according to Reuters. Congo‚Äôs president, F√©lix Tshisekedi, greeted the monarchs on a red carpet rolled out at the Kinshasa airport Tuesday. But some politicians and residents called for Belgium to go further to atone for the atrocities and discrimination their ancestors suffered.

At a news conference alongside Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, who traveled with the king and queen, Tshisekedi said he hoped stronger ties with Belgium would bring investment to Congo and improve health care. An estimated 73 percent of the Congolese population lives below the international poverty line, according to the World Bank.

‚ÄúWe have not dwelled on the past, which is the past and which is not to be reconsidered, but we need to look to the future,‚Äù Tshisekedi said, Reuters reported.

De Croo hailed the six-day trip as a ‚Äúhistoric moment.‚Äù

Belgium‚Äôs King Leopold II took power of Congo in 1885, when European leaders carved up Africa into imperial holdings. The king was given personal control over a swath of land he called the Congo Free State.

Some 10 million Congolese died from violence, famine and disease under Leopold‚Äôs direct rule, according to some estimates, and gruesome accounts emerged of the dismemberment of children in villages that did not produce enough rubber to satisfy their colonial overlords. Leopold‚Äôs rule was so bloody that it drew condemnation from other European leaders, and the government of Belgium later took over administration of the colony.

After the killing of George Floyd in the United States in 2020, protesters in Belgium vandalized statues of Leopold. Philippe‚Äôs comments this week echoed those he made in a letter to Tshisekedi that June, on the 60th anniversary of Congo‚Äôs independence, when he became the first Belgian official to voice regret for the country‚Äôs imperial abuses.

European countries have made some efforts in recent years to own up to their colonial pasts, as activists at home and in former colonies demand a reckoning over historical atrocities. In 2021, Germany apologized for massacres by German colonial forces of the Herero and Nama people in Namibia, which Germany has acknowledged as genocide. Dutch King Willem-Alexander apologized for the ‚Äúexcessive violence‚Äù the Netherlands used when it colonized Indonesia.

But most countries have not gone that far. French President Emmanuel Macron has launched efforts to probe France‚Äôs colonization of Algeria but ruled out issuing an official apology. Scars still run deep in both France and Algeria from the colonial period and the brutal war that ended it.

Some European nations have also moved to return artifacts looted from their former colonies. Philippe on Wednesday handed back to Congolese authorities a five-foot-tall Kakungu mask, which had been used in ceremonies by the Suku people in Congo‚Äôs southwest. The object was included in an inventory of 84,000 objects taken from Congo during the colonial period that the Belgian government gave to the Congolese government in February. Many are housed just outside Brussels, at Belgium‚Äôs Royal Museum for Central Africa.

The mask is on ‚Äúindefinite loan‚Äù to Congo, since Belgium does not have a legal avenue for donating works held in federal collections, according to Belgium‚Äôs VRT news site. Belgium‚Äôs legislature is weighing a law that will create a legal framework for the restitution of colonial-era artifacts.

Belgium also plans to return a tooth ‚Äî the last remains of Congo‚Äôs first post-independence prime minister, Patrice Lumumba ‚Äî who was killed in 1961 after a Brussels-backed coup.

For some in Congo, the gestures are not enough. Responding to a statement from De Croo on Twitter on Wednesday that the countries would pivot their focus to the future, Congolese opposition senator Francine Muyumba Nkanga wrote, ‚ÄúWe will never turn toward the future without apology and reparations from Belgium.‚Äù

By Richard Norton-Taylor

Declassified UK

J ournalists who receive some funding from foreign governments are at risk of committing offences under a bill that carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The risk also applies to individuals working for civil society organisations such as human rights groups.

It would be an offence to disclose leaked information that would prejudice the ‚Äúsafety or interests of‚Äù the U.K. What constituted such prejudice would be entirely a matter for ministers to decide and there would be no defence to argue that the publication was in the public interest.

The sweeping new threat to freedom of expression is contained in the National Security Bill, which is being championed by Home Secretary Priti Patel.

Although the government has claimed the measure is designed to prevent new types of spying, the bill is much broader, wider even than the much-criticised section 1 of the 1911 Official Secrets Act it would replace.

The 1911 Act refers to the obtaining or communication of information ‚Äúcalculated to be or might be or is intended to be directly or indirectly useful to an enemy‚Äù (emphasis added).

Also under the bill, ministers and spies would be given immunity from collusion in serious crimes overseas.

Life Imprisonment

The Freedom of Information (FoI) Campaign and Article 19, the global campaign for free expression, describe the bill as a major extension of the scope of offences in the 1911 Act.

They say: ‚ÄúA civil society organisation engaged in legitimate activities which has some funding for work on environmental, human rights, press freedom, asylum, aid or other issues from a friendly government could commit an offence under the bill.‚Äù

The prosecution would need to show only that such organisations had made use of leaked information ‚Äúwhich they knew or should have known was restricted to avoid prejudicing the U.K. ‚Äôs safety or interests and that its use did prejudice the U.K.‚Äôs safety or interests.‚Äù

The organisations add:

‚ÄúThe decision on what constituted the U.K. ‚Äôs safety or interests would be the government‚Äôs and could not be challenged in court. If the government decided that the U.K. ‚Äôs energy situation required an immediate expansion of fracking or the building of coal fired or nuclear power plants, the use of leaked information which could undermine that policy could be a criminal offence under the bill. ‚ÄúThe prosecution would only have to show that the information prejudiced the attainment of the government‚Äôs policy in the U.K. ‚Äôs interests and that the person who used the information received funding from a foreign government.‚Äù

On conviction, that person could face life imprisonment.

Overseas Funding

The FoI Campaign and Article 19 point out that the same would be true if an organisation with overseas government funding to confront the problems of asylum seekers used leaked information to oppose the U.K. government‚Äôs asylum policies.

The government could assert that these were necessary in the U.K.‚Äôs interests.

A journalist working for another government‚Äôs state broadcaster ‚Äì including that of a friendly state ‚Äì who reports on a leak of protected information which is held to be prejudicial to the U.K. ‚Äôs interests, would also commit an offence under the bill if they knew or ought to have known that the broadcast would prejudice the U.K. ‚Äôs safety or interests.

The fact that the journalist was paid by the funds of a foreign government department or agency and that the broadcasting organisation itself was financed by such funds would satisfy the foreign power condition.

They would also face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

Yet a journalist working for a U.K. news organisation responsible for an identical report based on the same leak could not commit this offence because the foreign power condition would not apply.

Richard Norton-Taylor is a British editor, journalist and playwright, and the doyen of British national security reporting. He wrote for The Guardian on defence and security matters and was the newspaper‚Äôs security editor for three decades.

Select committee chair Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) began the hearing with a sweeping statement: Trump attempted to thwart the peaceful transfer of power and spurred ‚Äúa mob of domestic enemies of the Constitution‚Äù to attack the Capitol. And in a nod to doubters, he augmented his statement with an excerpt of video testimony from former Attorney General Bill Barr, who said he told Trump his claims of election fraud were ‚Äúbullshit.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt live in a world where the incumbent administration stays in power based on its view, unsupported by specific evidence, that there was fraud in the election,‚Äù Barr said, adding that it contributed to his decision to leave the Trump administration in Dec. 2020.

In her own opening statement, committee vice chair Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) confirmed reports that while members of the Jan. 6 mob chanted ‚ÄúHang Mike Pence,‚Äù Trump said to aides, ‚ÄúMaybe our supporters have the right idea. Mike Pence deserves it.‚Äô‚Äù

Relying on video testimony from Barr, as well as Trump campaign advisers Jason Miller and Alex Cannon, Cheney laid out a case that Trump was repeatedly informed by his allies that his claims of fraud were wrong and insufficient to reverse the outcome of the election. But Trump persisted in making the public claims anyway, she noted. Cheney similarly played a brief video clip of Ivanka Trump‚Äôs testimony, in which she said she believed Barr when he said there was insufficient evidence of fraud to influence the outcome of the election.

Miller noted on Twitter that Trump responded to his advisers‚Äô doubts by suggesting they were underestimating the prospect of winning some of their pending legal challenges.

Cheney also pushed back on some GOP lines of attack about Jan. 6, saying though the panel would present information on how the Capitol should have been better prepared, the U.S. Capitol Police should not be blamed.

‚ÄúWe will not blame the violence that day, violence provoked by President Trump, on the officers who bravely defended all of us,‚Äù she said.

The video about Trump‚Äôs tweet, narrated by a select committee investigator, showed how social media chatter about stopping the transition of power picked up following the then-president‚Äôs ‚Äúwild‚Äù promise ‚Äî and how extremists in the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers viewed it as a call to action.

One of the panel‚Äôs two live witnesses Thursday night, documentarian Nick Quested, was embedded with the Proud Boys before Jan. 6 and witnessed their discussions about the plan to descend on Washington. He told the select committee he watched the Proud Boys gather at the Washington monument and march to the Capitol, where they approached access points to the Capitol that were thinly guarded by police.

The other live witness, Capitol Police officer Caroline Edwards, was wounded in the first moment of violence after a rioter who‚Äôd just huddled with a Florida Proud Boy charged through a law enforcement perimeter.

Edwards described the confrontation with rioters, when she was briefly knocked unconscious but later returned to duty.

‚ÄúWhat I saw was just a war scene,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere were officers on the ground. They were bleeding. They were throwing up. I saw friends with blood all over their faces. I was slipping in people‚Äôs blood. I was catching people as they fell. It was carnage. It was chaos.‚Äù

The panel focused on the Proud Boys‚Äô behavior to foment the attack on the Capitol. Several of their leaders have been charged with seditious conspiracy, a crime that requires an intent to violently oppose the government.

The Justice Department has described Proud Boys as playing a leadership role within the mob that day, leading Trump supporters to the foot of the Capitol and ultimately inside. In court documents, prosecutors described Proud Boys discussions about using regular members of the mob ‚Äî ‚Äúnormies,‚Äù as the group described them ‚Äî to ratchet up the violence.

Enrique Tarrio, the group‚Äôs national chair, testified to the select committee in February. His attorney said in court papers Wednesday that Tarrio answered some of the committee‚Äôs substantive questions.

The committee also featured video testimony from some of the people who joined the mob that disrupted the certification of 2020 Electoral College votes, stoked by Trump‚Äôs false claims that the election was stolen.

That testimony lays the foundation for the committee‚Äôs series of hearings planned this month. The attack on the Capitol sent Congress and then-Vice President Mike Pence fleeing for safety and injured more than 140 police officers.

The select panel views Trump as singularly responsible for motivating the violence by propagating baseless election fraud allegations and embracing fringe theories about Pence‚Äôs ability to single-handedly overturn the election on Jan. 6, when he presided over a joint session of Congress to count electoral votes.

The hearing also featured video testimony from several members of the mob who have since pleaded guilty and expressed remorse about their role in the crowd that day. Committee investigators‚Äô broad focus on the Trump ‚Äúwild‚Äù tweet was first reported earlier this year by The New York Times.

Some attributed their actions to Trump himself. In court filings, several have described their closed-door depositions to the select committee, saying they told the panel that they bought into Trump‚Äôs falsehoods about the election.

One of them, Greg Rubenacker, was among the first wave of rioters who entered the Capitol and joined a mob that famously chased Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman through the Senate wing of the building. Another, Annie Howell, told a judge she met with the select committee four times.

The audience for the hearing included Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police officers who fended off attackers, spouses of some Capitol and DC officers who died shortly after the riot and members of Congress who hid in the House gallery together to shelter from the mob.",0
35,https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-06-09-sudden-vaccines-deaths-are-now-so-common-theyve-assigned-a-syndrome-name-for-it-sudden-adult-death-syndrome-sads.html,"(Natural News) The murderous medical regime knows that covid vaccines are killing healthy young people at an alarming rate, so they‚Äôve suddenly assigned a medical label for the phenomenon in order to distract people from the truth. Now, healthy young people who suddenly die without any medical explanation are said to have died from Sudden Adult Death Syndrome (SADS) rather than from vaccines.

While SADS has existed in medical terminology long before covid, doctors and the media are now using this syndrome label in a new way: To try to explain away vaccine deaths. From what we can tell so far, there are no such ‚Äúsudden deaths‚Äù in unvaccinated young adults. So far, this seems to be happening solely among those who have been vaccinated.

The UK Daily Mail has published an article detailing this new so-called ‚Äúsyndrome‚Äù which is of course just a convenient label to mask the true underlying cause of these sudden deaths. The title of their article is, ‚ÄúHealthy young people are dying suddenly and unexpectedly from a mysterious syndrome ‚Äì as doctors seek answers through a new national register,‚Äù and it says that everyone under the age of 40, ‚Äú‚Ä¶may potentially be at risk of having Sudden Adult Death Syndrome (SADS).‚Äù

All people under the age of 40 are now supposed to ‚Äúget their hearts checked,‚Äù while oblivious doctors claim to be searching for the ‚Äúgenetic cause‚Äù behind SADS.

Never before in the history of medicine have doctors and the media urged young people to ‚Äúget their hearts checked.‚Äù This is only happening after the global push for covid vaccines which hijack the body‚Äôs cells and force them to create spike protein particles that cause blood clots.

Murderous doctors are killing young people en masse with ‚Äúclot shots‚Äù

You can‚Äôt make this up. The medical negligence, incompetence and even maliciousness behind all this is mind-boggling. Medical doctors who function as Big Pharma shills inject young people with gene therapy cocktails containing experimental mRNA sequences that produce spike proteins in the blood, contributing the artificial clotting. In some people, the clots build slowly over time, meaning many people are walking around with partially-formed blood clots in their circulatory system.

Because mRNA injections alter DNA and get incorporated into the genetic code ‚Äî source: researchers from Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) ‚Äî some of the body‚Äôs cells continue to produce these pro-clotting spike proteins indefinitely. These clotting factors contribute to additional clot formation in the body, resulting in diminished cardiovascular function and ‚Äî importantly ‚Äî a reduction of blood flow to the brain, which results in a loss of higher cognitive capabilities. (This is likely why so many vaccinated people have become brain damaged / cognitively retarded and have plunged into animalistic rage emotional processing of the world around them.)

At some point, one or more of the clots in the body completely shuts off the blood circulation necessary to maintain consciousness. At this point, the person loses consciousness and dies. Often this happens when they are driving, flying an airplane or even sleeping at night. This is why so many pilots are dying on the flight deck, for example, which is a major cause contributing to the current nationwide shortage of commercial airline pilots.

A doctor named Dr. Elizabeth Paratz ‚Äî who claims to be wondering ‚Äúwhat genes cause this‚Äù syndrome ‚Äî says that 90 percent of these spontaneous deaths occur outside the hospital. (Source: UK Daily Mail)

Australia is now launching a ‚ÄúSADS registry‚Äù to try to solve the mystery of why seemingly healthy adults are spontaneously dying. They are doing this while pushing more mRNA injections onto those very people, apparently oblivious to the fact that mRNA injections are ‚Äúclot shots.‚Äù

It is widely known in the biosciences that viral genetic code is readily and automatically incorporated into human DNA

mRNA injections aren‚Äôt even technically vaccines. They are ‚Äúgene therapy‚Äù experimental medicines that alter not just cellular protein synthesis but are even incorporated into human DNA via reverse transcription. It turns out that a significant percentage of human DNA was acquired via this very process over many thousands of generations, where genetic material circulating in the environment is incorporated into human chromosomes. This phenomenon is widely known even in the conventional scientific community.

‚ÄúNon-retroviral RNA virus sequences have been detected in the genomes of many vertebrate species, including humans,‚Äù said biomedical researcher Liguo Zhang from MIT‚Äôs Whitehead Institute. (Source: MIT.edu)

Zhang even ran an experiment to test if SATS-CoV-2 viral fragments might incorporate themselves into human DNA:

With this in mind, Zhang and Jaenisch began to design experiments to test whether this viral integration could be happening with the novel coronavirus. With the help of Jaenisch lab postdoc Alexsia Richards, the researchers infected human cells with coronavirus in the lab and then sequenced the DNA from infected cells two days later to see whether it contained traces of the virus‚Äô genetic material.

In all samples, they found fragments of viral genetic material‚Ä¶

In other words, parts of the SARS-CoV-2 were incorporated into the DNA of human cells. Another researcher explains:

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a very clear footprint for LINE1 integration,‚Äù Jaenisch says. ‚ÄúAt the junction of the viral sequence to the cellular DNA, it makes a 20 base pair duplication.

Anyone claiming spike protein genetic code can‚Äôt be incorporated into DNA is flatly ignorant of the state of modern genetic science.

Spike protein mRNA becomes human DNA which turns the body into a clotting factory

As the above experiment shows, when the body is injected with genetic material, some of that material can be incorporated into the chromosomes of living cells. Although this is an oversimplification of the mechanisms in play, the overall result is the same: The body becomes a factory for spike proteins, producing them far beyond the intended time window during which an mRNA vaccine might be expected to function.

In other words, the vaccinated person becomes a walking spike protein factory that can never be turned off. From that point, they become a spike protein shedding machine while increasingly dumping self-synthesized spike proteins into their own circulating blood.

Over time, this forms blood clots. When those clots complete their blockage or large arteries, blood can no longer reach the brain. When the brain has no blood supply, brain death occurs, and the death of the body quickly follows.

This is now being called ‚ÄúSudden Adult Death Syndrome‚Äù even though it‚Äôs clearly caused by vaccine-induced blood clots.

Here‚Äôs a photo of a blood clot taken from a covid patient. It shows the clotting power of the spike protein, which is also present in covid vaccines:

Billions of people on our planet are now at risk of blood clot-induced sudden death, all by design: Vaccine Depopulation Syndrome

In summary, the murderous medical regime first injects billions of people with a biological weapon that might kill them, then they pretend to be shocked and surprised when so many healthy young adults start dying for no apparent medical reason. Do these medical monsters have no humanity (or scientific credibility) remaining at all?

Although this syndrome is called SADS, what‚Äôs really sad is that it was all done on purpose in order to achieve global depopulation. If anything, these deaths should be labeled, ‚ÄúVaccine Depopulation Syndrome‚Äù deaths. But of course the media and the medial tyrants are working triple time to cover all this up, and they know that dead vaccine victims don‚Äôt talk, so they can‚Äôt tell the living humans to save themselves by avoiding these deadly jabs.

As US President Joe Biden greets more than 20 Western Hemisphere leaders in Los Angeles, one of those excluded from the California gathering is holding his own high-level talks on the other side of the globe: Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro has hastily flown to Ankara to meet with his Turkey counterpart.

The Summit of the Americas, a triennial gathering of regional leaders from Alaska to Patagonia that the US is hosting for the first time since 1994, is the Biden's administration strongest effort to push the US agenda in the Western Hemisphere. But the organization of the summit has been far from perfect.

Leaders of Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela were excluded from the meeting because of their autocratic governments and poor human rights records -- prompting leaders of several other countries to boycott the Summit in solidarity. In the most notable defection, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador sent lower-ranking officials in his stead.

Cuba, which had been invited to previous summits in 2018 and 2015 and expected to be invited this year too, called its exclusion ""undemocratic.""

Suleyman has already hired several of his former colleagues. Bloomberg | Getty Images

Artificial intelligence gurus are quitting top jobs at companies like Google, Meta, OpenAI and DeepMind and joining a new breed of start-ups that want to take AI to the next level, according to people familiar with the matter and LinkedIn analysis. Four of the best-funded new AI start-ups ‚Äî Inflection, Cohere, Adept and Anthropic ‚Äî have recently poached dozens of AI scientists with backgrounds in Big Tech. Their hiring efforts are being fueled by venture capital firms and billionaires keen to cash in on any success they have. Collectively, these firms have raised over $1 billion and they're using these vast war chests to poach talented individuals who command high salaries from their previous employers. The start-ups are building their products and services with a relatively new ""architecture,"" which is a set of rules and methods that's used to describe the functionality, organization and implementation of a computer system. The new architecture ‚Äî developed by a team of Google staff in 2017 and now available for anyone to use ‚Äî is known as a ""transformer."" The transformer allows AI systems to be scaled in ways that had never been considered before, meaning it's possible to make them far more powerful and capable. ""When you started scaling up these models, the capabilities just grew in a way that I think no one predicted,"" Cohere CEO Aidan Gomez told CNBC. ""It was like a total shock."" OpenAI's GPT-3 and Dalle-E, Google's Bert, and DeepMind's AlphaFold and AlphaStar are all examples of breakthrough AI systems that are underpinned by a transformer.

Inflection AI

Launched in March, Inflection AI has already raised over $225 million despite having fewer than 10 employees, according to LinkedIn. Headquartered in California, the company's aim is to develop AI software products that make it easier for humans to communicate with computers. It is led by DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman, who recently left his VP of AI product management and AI policy role at Google. LinkedIn billionaire Reid Hoffman and former DeepMind researcher Karen Simonyan are the other co-founders. Suleyman has already hired several of his former colleagues. Former DeepMinder Heinrich Kuttler left his research engineering manager role at Meta AI in London in March to become a member of the founding team at Inflection, working on the technical side of the business, according to his LinkedIn page. Elsewhere, Joe Fenton left his senior product manager role at Google in February also to become a member of the founding team at Inflection, working on the product side of the business. More recently, Rewon Child, a former Google Brain and OpenAI researcher, joined Inflection as a member of technical staff. Inflection has also hired Maarten Bosma, who was previously a research engineer at Google. Meta and Google did not respond to a CNBC request for comment. One of Inflection's best-known investors is Greylock Partners, a renowned venture capital firm in Silicon Valley that made early bets on the likes of Facebook (now Meta) and Airbnb. Hoffman and Suleyman are partners at the firm. On a call with CNBC in March, Suleyman said: ""If you think about the history of computing, we have always been trying to reduce the complexity of our ideas in order to communicate them to a machine."" He added: ""Even when we write a search query, we're simplifying, we're reducing or we're writing in shorthand so that the search engine can understand what we want."" When humans want to control a computer, they need to learn a programming language in order to provide instructions, he added, or use a mouse to navigate and engage with things on the screen. ""All of these are ways we simplify our ideas and reduce their complexity and in some ways their creativity and their uniqueness in order to get a machine to do something,"" Suleyman said. The British entrepreneur claimed a new suite of technologies that Inflection will aim to develop will eventually enable anyone to speak to a computer in plain language. It's unclear at this stage who Inflection will sell its products to, at what price, and when.

Cohere

Inflection is competing for talent with Cohere, which was founded in Toronto in 2019 by Aidan Gomez, Ivan Zhang and Nick Frosst. Cohere, which has raised around $170 million from the likes of Index Ventures and Tiger Global, wants to create an interface that allows software developers to use complicated AI technology on their apps. This AI technology, known as natural language processing, or NLP, should allow developers to deploy new features and services into their software products. ""We want to build that toolkit that's accessible to any dev,"" CEO Gomez told CNBC on a call. AI luminaries and DeepMind alums Ed Grefenstette and Phil Blunsom are among the latest AI scientists to join Cohere, with the duo announcing last month that they've joined the firm. Grefenstette is Cohere's head of machine learning and Blunsom is the company's chief scientist. They'll also be responsible for helping to set up a new Cohere office in London, which has become a hotbed for AI talent over the last decade. Indeed, DeepMind now employs over a thousand people in the city, many of them PhDs. They'll likely be able to scout out promising potential recruits from two of the U.K.'s leading universities. Grefenstette is an honorary professor at UCL, while Blunsom is a professor at Oxford.

Anthropic

Another firm making waves is Anthropic, which is led by OpenAI's former VP of research Dario Amodei. Anthropic describes itself as an AI safety and research company. It says that it wants to build ""reliable interpretable, and steerable AI systems."" Amodei set up the firm with help from several other ex-OpenAI employees, including Jack Clark, Tom Brown, Sam McCandlish and his sister Daniela Amodei. It launched in 2021 and announced it had secured $124 million from a cohort of investors including Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. In April, the company announced it raised another $580 million, and according to LinkedIn, it now has 41 staff.

At an extraordinary meeting, the Russian central bank cut interest rates to 11% from 14% and said further reductions could follow. Rates were hiked as high as 20% in the immediate aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February as the bank tried to prevent Western sanctions triggering a financial crisis.

""Inflationary pressure eases on the back of the ruble exchange rate dynamics as well as the noticeable decline in inflation expectations of households and businesses,"" the Russian central bank said in a statement.

38,https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-06-09-media-damage-control-vaccinated-americans-dying-covid.html,"(Natural News) American mainstream media outlets are working overtime to push out stories claiming that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines and boosters are effective when the reality is proving the opposite.

‚ÄúThe propaganda spinning immediately began as soon as the data began to show those who have been injected several times are not doing nearly as well as those who have refrained from taking the shots,‚Äù wrote Mac Slavo for SHTF Plan. ‚ÄúThe mainstream media wants you to know that it isn‚Äôt the booster shots that are increasing the risk of getting COVID.‚Äù (Related: Patrick Gunnels tells Dr. Lee Merritt: Americans are the most gaslit people in the world when it comes to vaccines ‚Äì Brighteon.TV.)

Alexander Tin, writing for CBS News, tried to claim that the rising hospitalization and death rates in American hospitals do not mean the booster vaccines are ineffective or that they somehow increase the risk of contracting COVID-19.

‚ÄúOngoing studies continue to provide strong evidence of additional protection offered by booster shots against infection, severe disease and death,‚Äù wrote Tin.

Instead, what CBS News is offering as a supposed justification for the sudden increase in COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths, is that the vaccines simply aren‚Äôt meant to prevent infections, merely lower the risk of hospitalization and death.

John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College, spoke to CBS News and admitted that the omicron variant, which mainstream media outlets fearmongered months ago, can still break through the antibody protections supposedly provided by COVID-19 vaccines.

But Moore added that fully vaccinated and boosted individuals who still contract breakthrough infections will only experience mild infections. He also went on to blame people for believing that they‚Äôre protected by the vaccine.

‚ÄúSo, one of the dynamics here is that people feel, after vaccination and boosting, that they‚Äôre more protected than they actually are, so they increase their risks,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat, I think, is the major driver of these statistics.‚Äù

Government still pushing for more vaccinations

Some of the data are too remarkable even for mainstream media outlets to deny. Information from the federal government shows that COVID-19 cases are on the uptick once again, but this time more of these new cases are coming from vaccinated and boosted Americans.

Furthermore, the data also shows that more and more fully vaccinated individuals are making up the number of people dying of COVID-19.

But despite media outlets admitting to this, government health officials still claim the best option for people is to get vaccinated and boosted.

‚ÄúAlmost no one in this country should be dying from COVID‚Äù if only they get vaccinated and take their boosters, claimed Dr. Robert Califf, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), during an appearance on CNN. ‚ÄúWhat we really should be worried about is getting the boosters that we need to stay up to date so with the new variants that we have, we don‚Äôt have the unnecessary deaths and hospitalizations.‚Äù

Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA‚Äôs Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, also claimed that a surge is coming this fall and winter and the only way to prevent it is to get more Americans vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really important that we try to get the half ‚Äì or a little bit more than half ‚Äì of Americans who have only received two doses to get that third dose,‚Äù he said, during a different appearance on CNN. ‚ÄúThat may make a difference moving forward here, and it may particularly make a difference now that we‚Äôre coming into yet another wave of COVID-19.‚Äù

Both Shanghai and Beijing have started to relax their Covid restrictions after weeks of strict lockdowns. This opening-up ‚Äî combined with soaring government investment and plummeting stock valuations ‚Äî are creating investment opportunities, the banks say. In a research note dated June 8, Goldman Sachs named stocks to trade a ""turbulent"" Asian market, identifying several names set to benefit from government investment. In April, China's President Xi Jinping called for an ""all-out"" effort to construct infrastructure such as roads, rail and waterways. In its ""Select China 'New Infra'"" basket of stocks, Goldman named smartphone maker Xiaomi and software firm Chinasoft International . It also chose solar firm Xinyi Solar , acoustics company AAC and telco giant China Telecom . ""Stocks with exposure to the environmental theme or in the China 'new infra' industries can benefit from the global climate change initiative and Chinese govt. support on emerging industries & technologies,"" the analysts, led by Alvin So, wrote. Meanwhile, Goldman's ""Environmental & Renewables"" basket of stocks included wind power company China Longyuan Power , lithium producer Ganfeng Lithium , utilities company Beijing Enterprises Water and Canadian Solar , a renewables firm that operates in mainland China and trades on the Nasdaq. It also named energy investment company China Everbright .

25,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/06/10/ruth-bader-ginsburg-retire-legacy-00038638,"Want to read more stories like this? POLITICO Weekend delivers gripping reads, smart analysis and a bit of high-minded fun every Friday. Sign up for the newsletter.

At 72, and having spent a career inside circles of power, Hunt is not exactly the target demographic for the Notorious RBG gear that became ubiquitous during Ginsburg‚Äôs late-life emergence as an unlikely Millennial meme machine. But over the years, she wound up with a couple of mugs depicting the champion of women‚Äôs rights, who died in 2020.

Recently, though, Hunt decided she didn‚Äôt want to see them. With the Supreme Court poised to reverse Roe v Wade, Ginsburg‚Äôs decision not to step down during the Obama administration looms large in the estimations of some of her admirers, who see it as enabling the destruction of large parts of Ginsburg‚Äôs legacy. The unintended ‚Äî but not unforeseeable ‚Äî result was that Donald Trump was able to name Ginsburg‚Äôs successor, who may wind up as the fifth vote to overturn the landmark 1973 abortion-rights ruling.

‚ÄúWhat I wanted to do was pack it away. I thought, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want to look at it,‚Äô‚Äù Hunt says. ‚ÄúI want to put it away for my children and my grandchildren. That took work. I‚Äôm 72, and if there‚Äôs something that grieves me, I want to get it out of my life. I didn‚Äôt want to see it again. It was too painful. I felt betrayed.‚Äù

That constellation of emotions has been increasingly common since POLITICO‚Äôs report last month of a draft opinion reversing Roe. Much of the wistfulness is felt not by disappointed idealist purchasers of lace-collar Halloween costumes or RBG refrigerator magnets, but by people who might have been the justice‚Äôs peers ‚Äî people well established in law, politics and public service, many of whom can empathize with the complicated feelings involved in calling it quits.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs certainly hard for me, now, to think of her work and of her ‚Äî and not to, these days, work up a degree of regret and anger,‚Äù says Dorothy Samuels, who authored The New York Times‚Äô legal editorials during her 30 years on the paper‚Äôs editorial board. ‚ÄúThis is so multilayered because she cared so passionately about advancing equality for everybody. She figured out a way to get women to be part of the constitution. And yet, what she has helped to give us is a court that for a long, long time is going to be undoing the equality rulings that she was part of.‚Äù

Samuels heard the same thing from former clerks and other inner-circle members while researching a book in the years before Ginsburg‚Äôs death. ‚ÄúIt was an extraordinarily self-centered thing to do.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe gambled,‚Äù says Michele Dauber, the outspoken Stanford law professor, speaking of Ginsburg‚Äôs apparent calculation that Hillary Clinton would be in the White House to appoint her successor. ‚ÄúBut she didn‚Äôt just gamble with herself. She gambled with the rights of my daughter and my granddaughter. And unfortunately, that‚Äôs her legacy. I think it‚Äôs tragic.‚Äù

Anyone looking to hide from Ginsburg‚Äôs image will have a hard time. Nearly two years after her death, the capital, and the country, remain awash in Ginsburgiana: Murals in New York, San Antonio, Kansas City, Denver, Baltimore, San Jose and beyond; a U.S. Navy ship; a New York hospital; a new species of praying mantis. According to data from Bookscan, sales of Irin Carmon and Shana Knizhnik‚Äôs Notorious RBG ‚Äî the ur-text of Ginsburg‚Äôs transformation from jurist to secular saint ‚Äî appear unaffected by the draft-ruling bombshell.

Ditto the ubiquitous RBG merch. ‚ÄúWe still carry a bunch of stuff with her image on it,‚Äù says Bradley Graham, who owns Washington‚Äôs Politics & Prose bookstore. ‚ÄúA cup, a doll, a candle. The sales on these kind of ebb and flow, but we haven‚Äôt detected any particular falloff. We‚Äôre still carrying them and still selling some. We just hear from some people that they‚Äôre mad at her.‚Äù

The connection between Ginsburg‚Äôs status as a pop-culture phenomenon and the choices she made about retirement, in fact, have become part of the posthumous finger-pointing. Was the cult of RBG one of the factors that propelled her to stick around instead of retiring at a politically safe moment?

‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard, before her death and after, the argument that, ‚ÄòWhy have you people made her this demigod?‚Äô‚Äù says Debbie Levy, the Washington-based author of two largely laudatory children‚Äôs books about Ginsburg. ‚ÄúI say, maybe somebody made her a demigod, I didn‚Äôt make her a demigod. I view her, I still view her, as a great person. This idea that if by elevating her as an example, we‚Äôve done this disservice. I would say, disservice to whom?‚Äù

The timeline also doesn‚Äôt quite work. Carmon and Knizhnik‚Äôs book only came out in 2015 ‚Äî while Obama was still president, but after the Democrats had lost the Senate. The Tumblr on which it was based launched in 2013. But the first calls for Ginsburg to retire for safe-replacement reasons came before the 2012 elections, by which point the justice had already gone through bouts of colon and pancreatic cancer. Those early calls for retirement were met with Ginsburg‚Äôs very same, characteristically stubborn, refusal to heed people telling her to get out.

Still, Ginsburg‚Äôs singular cultural status today adds a certain potency to the portions of the draft opinion where Justice Samuel Alito cites Ginsburg‚Äôs own publicly stated disagreements with Roe v. Wade (she had issues with aspects of the judicial and political approach, not the result). The asides enraged Ginsburg admirers, but also point to something that the justice‚Äôs feminist critics have noted in recent weeks: that the focus on RBG obscures scores of other movement colleagues ‚Äî including ones who may have had the better of her in certain arguments.

‚ÄúShe was very smart and very clever and very energetic, but she wasn‚Äôt the only game in town,‚Äù says Linda Hirshman, the lawyer and author of a dual biography of Ginsburg and Sandra Day O‚ÄôConnor.

Another thing the societal ardor for Ginsburg has done is make criticism of her choices more fraught. In 2014, Erwin Chemerinsky, now the dean at the University of California‚Äôs law school, wrote a POLITICO column urging her to step down. ‚ÄúI received a very angry response, including indirectly (through others) from Justice Ginsburg,‚Äù he told me by email. Same with Dauber, who sent a number of caustic tweets about ‚ÄúRBG cult members‚Äù and the legacy of her choice to stay.

‚ÄúHer clerks, women law professors, and women in society in general really felt that she is above criticism,‚Äù she says.

The fact is, people looking to cast blame for the rollback of abortion rights have a pretty long list of culprits before getting to Ginsburg: The justices who may write the decision, the presidents who appointed them, the GOP Senate that blocked Barack Obama‚Äôs third judicial nomination, the Democrats who didn‚Äôt pass a national abortion-rights bill when they had large majorities, the filibuster, the electoral college and on and on. You could even cite another judicial retirement decision: In 1991, Thurgood Marshall stepped down, declaring himself ‚Äúold and falling apart.‚Äù Marshall wound up living until four days after Bill Clinton‚Äôs inauguration ‚Äî meaning that if he‚Äôd somehow stayed put, Clarence Thomas might never have joined the Court to eventually vote down Roe.

‚ÄúI find it very hard to find fault with Ruth Bader Ginsburg for any kind of sin against the women‚Äôs movement,‚Äù says Susan Estrich, the lawyer and longtime Democratic insider. ‚ÄúWhat we need to recognize is that she was there for all those years, not that she unfortunately succumbed to illness before she planned.‚Äù

‚ÄúBefore Ruth Ginsburg was ever on the court, she was an advocate who helped teach America about the meaning of equal protection and of gender justice,‚Äù says Reva Siegel, a Yale law professor who says her office contains a depiction of Ginsburg accompanied by the words ‚Äúmay her memory be a revolution.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnother way we can understand her legacy is to look outside of the United States Supreme Court today and see the future of reproductive justice growing in state legislatures and in state courts and in the streets where a new generation of Americans is going to give new constitutional expression to liberty and equality.‚Äù

To Hirshman, whose coverage of Ginsburg was generally but not uniformly positive, the bigger issue than one person‚Äôs unwise choice is her view of why Ginsburg made the decision ‚Äî a factor that‚Äôs relevant to all sorts of Washington players these days: Ginsburg‚Äôs age. Hirshman, who is 78, believes the justice had lost her ‚Äúconnection to the existing zeitgeist‚Äù in the country. Someone more in touch, she says, would have had a clearer understanding of the radicalism of her opponents and their willingness not to abide by old norms.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very difficult question ‚Äî should people be braying about how it‚Äôs all Ruth Bader Ginsburg‚Äôs fault?‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe more interesting question is, how did we get to this point where all of these old people are making these decisions? I‚Äôm not saying that only having people in their 50s and 60s guarantees a good outcome. I‚Äôm just saying it raises the odds‚Ä¶.You really don‚Äôt want to gamble with the fate of the most powerful democratic republic in the world.‚Äù

In retrospect, Hirshman says, taking a gamble against actuarial odds will lead to undoing much of Ginsburg‚Äôs work. Not taking that bet, in other words, could have helped preserve that legacy: ‚ÄúRetiring might have made her more important than every decision she wrote on the Supreme Court.‚Äù",1

Inflation in May reached a new pandemic-era peak of 8.6 percent compared with a year earlier, with soaring energy, housing and food prices driving up costs at the fastest pace in 40 years. Compared with April, May prices rose 1 percent, according to the latest snapshot issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and known as the consumer price index. The brutal report surprised economists and makes clear just how inescapable inflation has become for millions of American households, dealing with higher rent, bigger gas bills, and rising grocery costs.

‚ÄúWhatever Washington has done to try to fix the cost of living crisis in America, it isn‚Äôt working,‚Äù Chris Rupkey, the chief economist at the research firm FWDBonds, said in an analyst note. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt just Russia and Ukraine anymore.‚Äù

Stocks fell sharply on the unexpectedly high inflation report. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 880 points, or 2.7 percent. The S&P 500 shed 2.9 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index sank 3.5 percent.

The stunning run-up in gas prices has become one of the most visceral ways people feel inflation in their daily lives. As of Friday morning, the national average for a gallon of gas was $4.99, according to AAA.

Inflation continues to deliver major economic and political consequences in the United States, with companies absorbing rising costs, consumers depleting savings and Democrats fretting about fallout in the upcoming November elections. There were hopes in Washington that inflation might ease this summer, but Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine in February pushed energy prices up sharply, and global leaders are scrambling to manage the fallout.

Gas and other energy prices were not the sole drivers of May‚Äôs bleak inflation report. Categories for shelter, airfare, used cars and trucks, and new vehicles were among the largest contributors. The cost of medical care, household furnishings and clothing also rose.

The food index increased 10.1 percent for the 12 months ending in May, the first double-digit increase since 1981. Measures for dairy and related products rose 2.9 percent in May, compared with April, their largest monthly increase since July 2007. Meats, poultry, fish and eggs rose 1.1 percent over the month, with the index for eggs rising 5.0 percent.

In Charlotte, rising food and fuel costs have hit Zada Jane‚Äôs Corner Cafe. Any menu items with chicken have been marked up $2.50 or $3, general manager Courtney Varnum said. Their own suppliers are slapping fuel surcharges on deliveries and requiring that orders be large enough to make the cost of transportation worthwhile. The only cost that has fallen is labor: The brunch spot employed around 40 workers pre-pandemic but is down to 19.

Varnum said loyal customers so far understand why the restaurant has had to raise prices. But she wonders how long that will last.

Advertisement

‚ÄúAre people going to keep going out to eat? And gas prices ‚Äî are people going to keep driving places?‚Äù Varnum asked.

The index for airline fares continued to rise, increasing 12.6 percent in May after rising 18.6 percent the previous month. The index for used cars and trucks rose 1.8 percent in May after declining in each of the three prior months.

Rent rose 0.6 percent in May compared with April in the latest sign of a housing market that has become increasingly unequal. Shelter accounts for about one-third of the basket of goods and services used to measure the consumer price index.

Policymakers are especially concerned that if housing costs don‚Äôt come down, it will be that much harder for overall inflation to return to more normal levels. Months of tough inflation reports have put pressure on the Biden administration and Federal Reserve to stabilize prices.

‚ÄúI think 8.3, 8.5, 8.6 percent are all roughly the same number,‚Äù said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former head of the Congressional Budget Office and the president of the conservative American Action Forum. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre looking at is sustained high inflation that we need to control.‚Äù

The Biden administration has declared inflation its top economic priority and has taken steps to lower prices at the pump, by tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and allowing blended biofuels to be sold. President Biden has largely blamed the surge on the Russian invasion in Ukraine, dubbing it ‚ÄúPutin‚Äôs price hike‚Äù that is spilling over into sectors beyond energy and food, namely airfares.

In a statement Friday, Biden called on Congress to pass legislation that would lower costs for energy bills, shipping costs and prescriptions drugs, and warned the oil industry from capitalizing on high gas prices to rake in excessive profits.

‚ÄúToday‚Äôs report underscores why I have made fighting inflation my top economic priority,‚Äù the statement read. ‚ÄúEven as we continue our work to defend freedom in Ukraine, we must do more ‚Äî and quickly ‚Äî to get prices down here in the United States.‚Äù

For everyday drivers, gas prices, in particular, are acting as a kind of billboard for the rising cost of living.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in uncharted territory,‚Äù said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. He added that ‚Äúit‚Äôs not something that‚Äôs going to turn around anytime soon, I‚Äôm afraid.‚Äù

While inflation has weighed on all households, higher prices have dealt a particularly tough blow to lower-income families, many of whom have exhausted safety nets and cushions built up from last year‚Äôs stimulus programs.

In Chicago, the number of people served by Lincoln Park Community Services, a homeless shelter, has jumped from 422 individuals last year to 1,400 so far this year, as the cost of groceries, gas and rent has soared. Chief executive Cheryl Hamilton-Hill said food costs at the nonprofit have doubled since last year.

Organization leaders are having to rethink how often they can afford to serve meat and fresh produce. Hamilton-Hill knows that some people in need of food have been visiting grocery stores when they put out samples or go by restaurants after they discard unused food for the day.

She‚Äôs seeing the toll of high gas prices, too. Her own employees are stretched to cover their commutes or outreach in the community as the cost per gallon skyrockets.

‚ÄúThis morning when I was driving to work, I think the sign said $8.02,‚Äù Hamilton-Hill said.

Most Americans expect inflation to get worse in the next year and are adjusting their spending habits in response to rising prices, according to a poll conducted by The Washington Post and George Mason University‚Äôs Schar School of Policy and Government. On Friday, a closely watched consumer sentiment survey from the University of Michigan also showed a jump in people‚Äôs inflation expectations over the long term.

Advertisement

That kind of psychological toll is one of the reasons inflation has become a major political threat to Biden and congressional Democrats going into the midterms this year.

Friday‚Äôs data also comes amid growing fears of stunted economic growth worldwide. On Tuesday, the World Bank slashed its annual global growth forecast to 2.9 percent, from January‚Äôs 4.1 percent, and warned that the global economy may suffer from 1970s-style stagflation, a dangerous combination of weak growth and rising prices. And on Thursday, the European Central Bank announced it will raise interest rates at its July meeting by a quarter of a percentage point in its fight against inflation.

Much depends on whether the Federal Reserve manages to cool down the economy without acting so forcefully that it causes a recession. The Fed is on a path to raising interest rates seven times this year and will enact the third of those hikes next week. It is expected to raise rates by half a percentage point, similar to its May meeting, signaling aggressive moves are needed to keep inflation from becoming more persistent and entrenched in the economy.

Advertisement

‚ÄúInflation will come down from this pace on its own,‚Äù said Jason Furman, an economics professor at Harvard University who served as an adviser during the Obama administration. ‚ÄúIt is just is a question of how much it will come down.‚Äù

There are a few encouraging signs in the economy. The red-hot housing market is also starting to cool, as a run-up in mortgage rates discourages aspiring buyers from competing for the few homes available.

There are also limits to what the Fed can do to curb rising prices. Interest rate hikes cannot boost oil supply, bring more people into the labor market or end a war. Energy prices around the world have been rising for months, a reflection of the continuing ripple effects from Russia‚Äôs ongoing war in Ukraine.

And though the Fed is in charge of controlling inflation, rising prices have soured Biden‚Äôs approval ratings for months and the White House has struggled to convince Americans that the economy is working for them.

At the same time inflation is so high, the labor market is unsustainably hot, with about two job openings for every person looking for work. The Fed‚Äôs goal is that higher interest rates can slow down hiring by making it more expensive for businesses to invest and hire.

In an interview with CNBC last week, Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard made clear the central bank is a long way from seeing progress.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be looking for a consistent string of data on both the strength of demand, the labor market coming into better balance, and of course, importantly, a string of decelerating inflation data to feel more confident,‚Äù she said.

By Dr Joseph Mercola

Each year, the world‚Äôs elite hop into their private jets and descend upon Davos, Switzerland, the location of the World Economic Forum‚Äôs (WEF) annual Davos Forum. Here, the self-proclaimed ruling class spend the week discussing their visions of the future and how to impose their ambitions on the rest of the world.1

As explained by Fox News anchor Jesse Watters, participants are divided into clear classes even there. Not only must you receive a personal invitation to attend, but once you‚Äôre there, your name badge will clearly illustrate which ‚Äúelite class‚Äù or ‚Äúsubclass‚Äù you belong to.

If you‚Äôre a sufficiently wealthy VIP, you get a white badge with a blue line. If you‚Äôre married to a VIP, you get a plain white badge. If you‚Äôre just part of someone‚Äôs entourage, you get a green badge (wouldn‚Äôt want the true elite braintrust WEF‚Äôs planners and strategists ‚Äî to accidentally mingle with and swap ideas with the servants).

The Future Is To Be Built by Them, Not Us

If you have any doubt that these individuals believe they have the right to own the world and make decisions for all mankind, just listen to WEF founder Klaus Schwab‚Äôs opening remarks:

‚ÄúThe future is not just happening. The future is BUILT, by US. By a powerful community, as you here, in this room.‚Äù

These three short sentences tell us a lot. They believe the future is theirs to create. They believe they, the attendees in that room, have all the power. And, by extension, they think that the rest of the world, those unfit to wear a Davos Forum badge, have no say in the matter.

We‚Äôre not powerful enough, or smart enough, or wealthy enough to be part of the planning. The people in that room, they are the ones responsible for making the decisions for everyone else.



They Want to Track Your Carbon Footprint

As noted by Watters, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre openly scheming up some of the craziest plans you‚Äôll ever hear of, like tracking your carbon footprint.‚Äù In other words, they want to track where you travel, how you travel, what you eat and any other resources you might use in your day-to-day life.

This technology isn‚Äôt commercially available yet, but we‚Äôre told it‚Äôs coming. To start, it‚Äôll be sold to you as a way for you to be a responsible citizen and track your own carbon footprint. Eventually, your carbon footprint will be part and parcel of your social credit score, and used against you in every conceivable and inconceivable way.

Make no mistake, the so-called ‚Äúmanmade climate change crisis‚Äù is a ploy to entice the world population into giving up the lifestyle we‚Äôve become used to, no matter how modest.

You‚Äôre supposed to track and limit your carbon footprint, while these self-proclaimed elitists have no qualms about hopping on their private jets. At bare minimum, you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd humble themselves enough to fly commercially, but no. They‚Äôre too important for that. They‚Äôre the builders of the future, after all.

Failed Planners Continue Planning

Of course, the meeting also included discussion about pandemic response. Despite having utterly failed to prevent any of their previously predicted pandemics ‚Äî and there have been several ‚Äî they still believe they‚Äôre the only ones who can get it done.

They also openly admit that their plans will cause pain for the populace. We have to expect shortages of food and energy, for example. And why? Because they‚Äôve decided societal changes need to occur faster than what technological advancement can keep up with.

As just one example, we currently don‚Äôt have viable alternatives to diesel-driven machinery used in construction and farming, but they‚Äôre not going to let that stop them from implementing their ‚Äúgreen‚Äù agenda.

They also stressed that ‚Äòinflationary pressures‚Äô are ‚Äòworth it.‚Äô But the average person who can‚Äôt afford to drive to work and whose children cry from hunger is hardly going to agree that premature implementation of the green agenda is worth that kind of suffering.

.

Do you want to know what their solution is? They continue their lifestyle, while demanding that you give up creature comforts like air conditioning and heating, or like driving your car and flying overseas, until the green energy sector catches up. Never mind the fact that by the time that happens, many millions will have died from starvation and society as we know it will have crumbled.

They also stressed that ‚Äúinflationary pressures‚Äù are ‚Äúworth it.‚Äù Worth it for whom? Themselves, of course, because the average person who can‚Äôt afford to drive to work and whose children cry from hunger is hardly going to agree that premature implementation of the green agenda is worth that kind of suffering. It‚Äôs tone-deaf in the extreme, really.

Watters asks Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul for comment on what‚Äôs happening in Davos, and as noted by Paul, one of the greatest dangers of a One World Government is that it will be unelected. Watch:

Just look at how bad government performs when you‚Äôre allowed to vote for the representatives you actually want, he says. This Davos crowd, which wants and fully intends to form their own global government, doesn‚Äôt represent anyone but themselves. You can‚Äôt vote them in. You can‚Äôt vote them out. And they‚Äôre accountable to no one.

Elitists Clueless About Basic Economy

Living in an insulated bubble is also, apparently, hazardous to your intellect. As noted by Paul, these elitists actually blame inflation on greed, which is dangerously ignorant, and proves they‚Äôre really not qualified to manage anything, let alone a global economy.

‚ÄúIf you were in a third-grade class, I‚Äôd give you a failing grade if you told me inflation was caused by greed,‚Äù Paul says. ‚ÄúThat is the dumbest explanation, the most implausible, lacking all facts, that someone could put forward.

Inflation is caused by an increase in the money supply ‚Ä¶ The Federal Reserve prints it up to borrow it; it floods the economy and drives prices up. If you don‚Äôt understand that, it‚Äôll never get any better. My prediction is it‚Äôll get a lot worse before November.‚Äù



World Health Organization Vies for Global Health Monopoly

Of course, global economies are not the only thing being destroyed by these billionaire parasites. They also want to be in charge of global health care, and to that end, the World Health Organization is now trying to get member states to agree to a Pandemic Treaty that will give the WHO complete authority over pandemic planning and response, even if its decisions violate national laws and civil rights.

It‚Äôs fitting then, that China was recently elected to the WHO‚Äôs executive board.2 Not a single member nation objected to the appointment. As noted by Spectator columnist Ross Clark,3 the election of China is further evidence WHO has ‚Äúlost all credibility.‚Äù What‚Äôs more, Clark points out that the only European country on the WHO‚Äôs executive board is Slovakia, which also had one of the highest COVID-19 death rates.

‚ÄòSustainable Financing‚Äô of the WHO May Be Pure Fiction

Directing and coordinating international health is expensive, as you might imagine, so the World Health Assembly, the governing body for the WHO, has approved a draft decision, A75/9, which lays out the plan for ‚Äúsustainable financing‚Äù of the WHO.

According to a supporting document titled ‚ÄúA Healthy Return ‚Äî Investment Case for a Sustainably Financed WHO,‚Äù4 investing in the WHO ‚Äúprovides a return of at least U.S. $35 for every U.S. $1 invested.‚Äù

As noted by a Twitter user called Critical Sway,5 this return on investment claim is based on ‚Äúcomplex economic calculations‚Äù involving ‚Äúenormous sums of money, projects running worldwide over the next decade,‚Äù and factors in ‚Äúan incalculable number of unknown and unknowable variables.‚Äù The models for these calculations were done by staff at the Victoria University in Melbourne, Australia, and were funded by the WHO itself.

In other words, the return on investment claim could be completely fictitious, especially when you consider that ‚ÄúThis lot couldn‚Äôt accurately model one virus over the course of two years.‚Äù6 But they‚Äôll use these fantasy calculations to milk governments for more money, and government can then tell the people that their money (because all government money comes from your tax dollars) is being ‚Äúsecurely invested‚Äù and ‚Äúwell spent.‚Äù

Update on International Health Regulation Amendments

In addition to the WHO‚Äôs pandemic treaty, the World Health Assembly recently voted on a set of amendments7 to the International Health Regulations proposed by the Biden administration. These amendments would have stripped member nations of their sovereignty and given the WHO unprecedented power to restrict your medical freedoms and civil liberties in the name of biosecurity.8

The WHO, however, temporarily withdrew 12 of the 13 proposed amendments, May 25, 2022. That doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre off the table, though. Another hearing on these amendments has been scheduled for June 16 and 17, 2022. According to the Liberty Counsel,9 a number of African nations, Iran, Malaysia and Brazil objected to the amendments, for a variety of reasons.

The African nations reportedly want the proposed IHR amendments to be consolidated into the Pandemic Treaty rather than being done piecemeal separately.

So, we‚Äôre not out of the woods yet. We must continue to pressure the U.S. delegation to the World Health Assembly to oppose these amendments. Some nations have expressed support for giving the WHO the power to mandate global universal health care as well, and this is yet another reason to push for national sovereignty and oppose the WHO‚Äôs Pandemic Treaty.

Take Action Today to Preserve Freedom for Tomorrow!

As reported by the Organic Consumers Association:10

‚ÄúLockdowns and mandates are bad enough when they‚Äôre imposed by local officials. At least, they can‚Äôt hide from our protests. We can show up where they work and live, and we can vote them out in the next election. Things would be much worse if lockdowns and mandates were imposed from Geneva, Switzerland, by an unelected, corporate-controlled bureaucracy ‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs exactly what the pharmaceutical companies are working on now. TAKE ACTION! Tell the U.S. delegation to the World Health Assembly that you oppose their amendments to the International Health Regulations! According to the World Council for Health, these amendments would give control over the declaration of a public health emergency in any member state to the WHO Director-General ‚Äî even over the objection of the member state ‚Ä¶ Under the amendments they‚Äôve proposed, the U.S. would have just 48-hours to respond to a WHO risk assessment and accept or reject on-site assistance, forcing it to comply or face condemnation from the WHO and, potentially, sanctions from unfriendly nations. Even worse than that, under the amendments, the WHO could declare their public health emergency based on secret information from anonymous sources ‚Ä¶ Corruption at the WHO was already the ‚Äòbiggest threat to the world‚Äôs public health of our time‚Äô according to a 2015 investigation.11 We don‚Äôt need U.S. amendments to the International Health Regulations making it any easier for the pharmaceutical companies to wield their influence. ‚ÄòPut simply, the proposed IHR amendments are directed towards establishing a globalist architecture of worldwide health surveillance, reporting, and management,‚Äô says the World Council for Health.12 ‚ÄòConsistent with a top-down view of governance, the public will not have opportunities to provide input or criticism concerning the amendments. This, of course, is a direct violation of the basic tenets of democracy.‚Äô The anti-corporate-globalization movement killed the World Trade Organization‚Äôs attempt to establish a global dictatorship where a bureaucracy run by the world‚Äôs largest corporations could override local democracy. Now, like the regional trade agreements that replaced the WTO, the World Health Organization is trying to become a mini WTO just for the pharmaceutical industry to override national laws on the safety-testing and regulation of drugs and vaccines‚Äìvia pandemic Emergency Use Authorizations. We must act now!‚Äù

How to Become Ungovernable

While the Schwabs and Gateses of the world may appear invincible and too powerful to knock down, we should not give in to such mental traps. Always remember that there are literally many millions of us for each and every one of them.

They can‚Äôt impose their ambitions on us unless we let them. They need our permission and cooperation to rule over us. So, part of the answer is to become ungovernable. I‚Äôm not talking about anarchy, violence or acting ‚Äúout of control.‚Äù I mean forming parallel systems that operate completely outside of their control grid.

For example, a society that primarily relies on physical cash is ungovernable by technocrats because they can‚Äôt track everyone‚Äôs earning and spending. A society that refuses to carry geolocation trackers is ungovernable by technocrats because they don‚Äôt know where you are or what you‚Äôre doing.

They need all those data points in order to profile you, to create a digital identity of you. And without that digital identity, artificial intelligence cannot predict what you‚Äôre thinking or how you‚Äôll respond to a given stimuli. The less data they have on us, the less governable we become.

Top-Down Rule Is a Failed Model of Governance

In a May 2, 2022, article, Michael Driver highlighted some of the global cabal‚Äôs apparent weaknesses, noting we actually have a lot to be optimistic about. Here‚Äôs a longer than usual excerpt from this worthwhile read:13

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt worry about the World Economic Forum achieving their stated goals for 2030 ‚Ä¶ If history rhymes, it positively sings with the failure of such grandiose projects. The history books are littered with the corpses of centralized top-down ideas. The reason why we are not talking enough about the impossibility of Klaus Schwab‚Äôs Great Leap Forward is because the opposition are guilty of the same failure of basic understanding. The opposition is making the flawed assumption that this project is doable. In fact, the future is resistant to shaping. What we should all be preparing for is the failure of the WEF‚Äôs program. This should be a cause of profound optimism. Put simply the universe works against centralized top-down systemization. ‚ÄòThey‚Äôre swimming against the teleological tide of creation ‚Äî an impenetrable future, the inevitability of the new, while we are surfing the wave of ontological emergence with decentralization as the key to developing solutions via free and open debate. ‚ÄòMann Tracht, Un Gott Lacht‚Äô ‚Äî man plans and God laughs ‚Äî is a Yiddish proverb. Well, she must be positively ROFL at the collection of billionaires and world leaders gathered in a fake village in Switzerland busily stitching together their own petards. As David says in Psalm 59:8, ‚ÄòBut you, O Lord, shall laugh at them: You shall have all the nations in derision.‚Äô Derision and ridicule are the correct responses here, not abject panic. They are not going to succeed; Iron Mike got it right when he said ‚ÄòEveryone has a plan till they get punched in the face‚Äô ‚Ä¶ Schwab and his collection of command and control technocrats have taken the ideas of Stalin, Chairman Mao, Pol Pot and whoever wrote WeWork‚Äôs business plan and dressed them in new clothes. These threadbare robes are camouflaged with words such as ‚Äòstewardship,‚Äô which actually means the absence of democracy; ‚Äòsustainability,‚Äô roughly translated as ‚Äòyou eat bugs while we flamb√© the wagyu‚Äô; ‚Äòinclusivity,‚Äô which is a big club and you ain‚Äôt in it, and ‚Äòequity‚Äô which redistributes assets to billionaires and associated parasites ‚Ä¶ Every plan falls apart when you pull on its assumptions. The Great Reset sits on the implicit assumption that everything in nature can be known, ordered and controlled via technology. Some twisted fantasy they call artificial intelligence. A general theory that they claim applies to everyone and everything everywhere. Globalism from above is just another in a long line of narrative fantasies stretching all the way back through the failed ideologies of the last century ‚Äî communism, fascism, religious fundamentalism and so on. Our vital objective should be to avoid the fate of the victims of these failures ‚Ä¶ Get angry, then get with the repudiation. Get with the presentation and promotion of decentralized, ground up, emergent philosophies. Get with the optimism. We are on the right side of history; they are on the precipice.‚Äù

29,https://consortiumnews.com/2022/06/09/global-warming-after-emissions-end/,"Climate scientist Julien Emile-Geay discusses the implications of ‚Äúcommitted warming.‚Äù

By Julien Emile-Geay

USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences

By now, few people question the reality that humans are altering Earth‚Äôs climate. The real question is: How quickly can we halt, even reverse, the damage?

Part of the answer to this question lies in the concept of ‚Äúcommitted warming,‚Äù also known as ‚Äúpipeline warming.‚Äù

It refers to future increases in global temperatures that will be caused by greenhouse gases that have already been emitted. In other words, if the clean energy transition happened overnight, how much warming would still ensue?

Earth‚Äôs Energy Budget Out of Balance

Humans cause global warming when their activities emit greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the lower atmosphere, preventing it from escaping out to space.

Before people began burning fossil fuels to power factories and vehicles and raising methane-emitting cattle in nearly every arable region, Earth‚Äôs energy budget was roughly in balance. About the same amount of energy was coming in from the Sun as was leaving.

Today, rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere are more than 50 percent higher than they were at the dawn of the industrial age, and they‚Äôre trapping more of that energy.

Those carbon dioxide emissions, together with other greenhouse gases such as methane, and offset by some aspects of aerosol air pollution, are trapping energy equivalent to the detonation of five Hiroshima-style atomic bombs per second.

With more energy coming in than leaving, Earth‚Äôs thermal energy increases, raising the temperature of land, oceans and air and melting ice.

Warming in the Pipeline

The effects of tampering with Earth‚Äôs energy balance take time to show up. Think of what happens when you turn the hot water faucet all the way up on a cold winter day: The pipes are full of cold water, so it takes time for the warm water to get to you ‚Äì hence the term ‚Äúpipeline warming.‚Äù The warming hasn‚Äôt been felt yet, but it is in the pipeline.

There are three major reasons Earth‚Äôs climate is expected to continue warming after emissions stop.

First, the leading contributors to global warming ‚Äì carbon dioxide and methane ‚Äì linger in the atmosphere for a long time: about 10 years on average for methane, and a whopping 400 years for carbon dioxide, with some molecules sticking around for up to millennia. So, turning off emissions doesn‚Äôt translate into instant reductions in the amount of these heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere.

Second, part of this warming has been offset by man-made emissions of another form of pollution: sulfate aerosols, tiny particles emitted by fossil fuel burning, that reflect sunlight out to space. Over the past century, this global dimming has been masking the warming effect of greenhouse emissions. But these and other man-made aerosols also harm human health and the biosphere. Removing those and short-lived greenhouse gases translates to a few tenths of a degree of additional warming over about a decade, before reaching a new equilibrium.

Finally, Earth‚Äôs climate takes time to adjust to any change in energy balance. About two-thirds of Earth‚Äôs surface is made of water, sometimes very deep water, which is slow to take up the excess carbon and heat. So far, over 91% of the heat added by human activities, and about a quarter of the excess carbon, have gone into the oceans. While land-dwellers may be grateful for this buffer, the extra heat contributes to sea level rise through thermal expansion and also marine heat waves, while the extra carbon makes the ocean more corrosive to many shelled organisms, which can disrupt the ocean food chain.

Earth‚Äôs surface temperature, driven by the imbalance of radiant energy at the top of the atmosphere, and modulated by the enormous thermal inertia of its oceans, is still playing catch up with its biggest control knob: carbon dioxide concentration.

How Much Warming?

So, how much committed warming are we in for? There isn‚Äôt a clear answer.

The world has already warmed more than 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 F) compared to pre-industrial levels. Nations worldwide agreed in 2015 to try to prevent the global average from rising more than 1.5¬∞C (2.7 F) to limit the damage, but the world has been slow to react.

Determining the amount of warming ahead is complicated. Several recent studies use climate models to estimate future warming. A study of 18 Earth system models found that when emissions were cut off, some continued warming for decades to hundreds of years, while others began cooling quickly. Another study, published in June 2022, found a 42 percent chance that the world is already committed to 1.5 degrees.

The amount of warming matters because the dangerous consequences of global warming don‚Äôt simply rise in proportion to global temperature; they typically increase exponentially, particularly for food production at risk from heat, drought and storms.

Further, Earth has tipping points that could trigger irreversible changes to fragile parts of the Earth system, like glaciers or ecosystems. We won‚Äôt necessarily know right away when the planet has passed a tipping point, because those changes are often slow to show up. This and other climate-sensitive systems are the basis for the precautionary principle of limiting warming under 2¬∞C (3.6 F), and preferably, 1.5¬∞C.

The heart of the climate problem, embedded in this idea of committed warming, is that there are long delays between changes in human behavior and changes in the climate. While the precise amount of committed warming is still a matter of some contention, evidence shows the safest route forward is to urgently transition to a carbon-free, more equitable economy that generates far less greenhouse gas emissions.

Cheney on Thursday talked about how close the former president came to appointing Clark as acting attorney general, and that the former president wanted Clark to send a letter to Georgia and five other states saying that ‚Äúthe U.S. Department of justice had ‚Äòidentified significant concerns that may have impacted the outcome of the election.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúThis letter is a lie,‚Äù Cheney said.

Perry, who is now chair of the pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus, repeatedly pushed Trump‚Äôs chief of staff at the time, Mark Meadows, to implement the plan to sow doubt in the election results.

‚ÄúMark, just checking in as time continues to count down,‚Äù Perry texted Meadows on Dec. 26, 2020, according to messages released by the select panel. ‚Äú11 days to 1/6 and 25 days to inauguration. We gotta get going!‚Äù

These efforts were halted after other Justice Department leaders threatened to resign if Trump moved forward with selecting Clark as attorney general.

Perry has not complied with a subpoena for his testimony, and as POLITICO reported last week, the select committee was told that Meadows burned papers after meeting with the Republican in his office at the White House.

10,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/06/09/americas/dom-phillips-bruno-pereira-missing-suspect-intl-latam/index.html,"(CNN) Brazilian authorities said Wednesday they have detained a suspect in the case of a missing British journalist and indigenous affairs expert -- but are yet to establish whether the man was linked to their disappearance in a remote region of the Amazon.

Concerns are growing over the fate of Dom Phillips and Bruno Ara√∫jo Pereira, who were first reported missing in the Javari Valley , in the far western part of Amazonas state on Sunday. They had reportedly received death threats just days prior.

In a news conference Wednesday, Amazonas state security secretary general Carlos Alberto Mansur said the suspect remains under investigation in police custody.

Mansur said the man was arrested after being found in possession of ""a lot of drugs"" and ammunition used for illegal hunting.

Authorities said Wednesday they were pursuing several lines of investigation, including homicide, and added they still ""can't rule out anything.""

Gen. Placido (center) speaks between Eduardo Alexandre Fontes (right), Regional Superintendent of Amazonas State Federal Police and Col. Muniz during a news conference in Manaus, Brazil, on Wednesday.

Mansur noted that five other people have also been questioned by police in connection with the disappearance of Phillips and Pereira, who had traveled to the region to conduct research for a book project on conservation efforts in the region.

Ahead of the news conference, media organizations and family members of both missing men called for the federal government to step up their search efforts. Federal Police Superintendent Eduardo Alexandre Fontes said Wednesday that a total of 250 men, two helicopters, three drones and 16 boats have been deployed for the search and rescue operation.

Phillips and Pereira have been missing for more than 72 hours, according to the Coordination of the Indigenous Organization. The organization, known as UNIVAJA, said satellite information showed the pair's last known location in the S√£o Rafael community early on Sunday morning, where they were expected to meet a local leader who never showed up.

A ""dangerous"" region

Home to thousands of indigenous people and about 16 uncontacted groups, the Javari Valley -- the second largest indigenous territory in Brazil -- is a patchwork of rivers and dense forest that makes access very difficult. The area has come under increased threat from illegal miners, loggers, hunters and international drug traffickers exploiting its vast network of rivers.

On Wednesday, Federal Police Superintendent Fontes described the area where Phillips and Pereira went missing as ""complicated"" and ""dangerous.""

Phillips and Pereira had traveled to the region to conduct research for a book on conservation efforts there. Phillips, an Amazon specialist, had previously reported for British newspaper The Guardian on threats posed by illegal mining and cattle ranchers to uncontacted indigenous groups in the region.

Despite being under government protection, the Javari Valley can be a hostile environment for journalists and indigenous rights activists. According to Brazil's Public Prosecutor's Office, an indigenous affairs worker was murdered in the area in September 2019.

""In this region, violence is advancing in an increasingly uncontrolled manner in the context of the invasion of indigenous lands and lands that belong to the state, repression of the freedom of press and the work of journalists,"" UNIVAJA said in a statement.

In 2018, Phillips reported on the threats posed by illegal mining and cattle ranchers to uncontacted indigenous groups there, with Pereira at the heart of that article.

Survival International, an NGO that advocates for indigenous peoples, said Pereira had previously received ""many threats"" as a result of his work as an ""ally of the Indigenous struggle.""",0
30,https://consortiumnews.com/2022/06/09/us-taxpayers-spent-billions-inflating-ceo-pay/,"Sarah Anderson says Biden has the power to crack down on executive excess by imposing new CEO pay and buyback restrictions on federal contractors.

By Sarah Anderson

Inequality.org

A tight labor market created a rare moment of leverage for low-wage workers last year. But Corporate America took no great leap forward on pay equity.

A new Institute for Policy Studies report, ‚ÄúExecutive Excess 2022,‚Äù reveals how low-wage corporations have continued to pump up CEO pay during the pandemic while workers are struggling with rising costs.

The report zeroes in on compensation trends at the 300 publicly held U.S. corporations that reported the lowest median worker wages in 2020. At over a third of these firms ‚Äî 106 in all ‚Äî median worker pay either fell or failed to rise above the 4.7 percent average U.S. inflation rate in 2021.

By contrast, CEO pay at these same 300 low-wage firms soared 31 percent to an average of $10.6 million. This stunning increase drove the average gap between CEO and median worker pay at these companies to 670-to-1, up from 604-to-1 in 2020. At 49 of the 300 firms, pay ratios topped 1,000-to-1.

Amazon‚Äôs new CEO, Andy Jassy, raked in $212.7 million last year, making him the highest-paid CEO in our corporate low-wage sample. Jassy‚Äôs pay amounts to 6,474 times the $32,855 take-home of Amazon‚Äôs typical worker.

Of the 106 companies in our sample where median worker pay did not keep pace with inflation, 67 blew a combined total of $43.7 billion on stock buybacks. This financial maneuver inflates executive stock-based pay and drains capital from worker raises, R&D, and other productivity-boosting investments.

Corporate America‚Äôs perverse pay practices become even more disturbing when we consider another often overlooked reality: Ordinary Americans are supporting our inequitable corporate economic order through the hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded contracts and subsidies that flow every year to for-profit businesses.

Of the 300 companies in our sample, 40 percent received federal contracts totaling $37.2 billion over the past few years.

CEO pay apologists regularly argue that corporate leaders deserve their massive compensation packages because they bear enormous responsibilities and must take extraordinary risks.

This argument quickly falls apart when we compare CEOs at major contractors with the government officials ultimately responsible for their contracts.

The U.S. secretary of defense, for instance, manages the country‚Äôs largest workforce ‚Äî more than 2 million employees ‚Äî and makes life-and-death decisions on a daily basis. And yet the defense secretary and other Biden cabinet members make just $221,400 per year, less than three times as much as the $76,668 average federal employee annual pay.

By contrast, at the low-wage contractors we studied, CEO pay averaged $11.8 million and the average CEO-worker pay ratio sat at 571-to-1 in 2021.

Across the political spectrum, Americans are fed up with executive excess. One new poll shows that 87 percent see the growing gap between CEO and worker pay as a problem for the country.

President Joe Biden should not wait for Congress to tackle this problem. He already has the power to steer Corporate America in a more equitable direction through new standards for federal contractors, a set of companies that employ an estimated 25 percent of the U.S. private sector workforce.

Biden took an important step when he set a $15 per hour minimum wage for contractors. Now he should go further by making it hard for companies with huge CEO-worker pay gaps to land a lucrative deal with Uncle Sam.

Encouraging big companies to narrow their gaps is a matter of fairness ‚Äî but not only a matter of fairness. It would also help ensure that taxpayer-funded contractors perform high-quality work, since study after study has shown that extreme pay disparities tend to undermine employee morale and boost turnover rates.

The president could also require contractors to remain neutral in union organizing campaigns, a move consistent with his recent show of support for workers fighting CEOs‚Äô union-busting efforts at Amazon and Starbucks.

The Congressional Progressive Caucus called on Biden to take such actions in March.

The president could also prohibit CEOs from personally benefiting from stock bumps that occur when they make the decision to spend company resources on stock buybacks. This would help get the ball rolling on his proposal for legislation along these lines.

Executive actions, of course, can be repealed by future presidents. That‚Äôs one reason to continue pushing legislative solutions, such as raising the corporate tax rate on companies with large CEO-worker pay gaps.

Given the current congressional gridlock, though, the president should not hang back. The next White House occupant might want to undo these actions, but he or she would have a hard case to make. How do you persuade taxpayers they should be funding corporations that are fueling inequality?

At an extraordinary meeting, the Russian central bank cut interest rates to 11% from 14% and said further reductions could follow. Rates were hiked as high as 20% in the immediate aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February as the bank tried to prevent Western sanctions triggering a financial crisis.

""Inflationary pressure eases on the back of the ruble exchange rate dynamics as well as the noticeable decline in inflation expectations of households and businesses,"" the Russian central bank said in a statement.

It says FBI agents offered to contact an attorney for Navarro, but he wanted to use his phone to let a media outlet know he was likely to miss a scheduled TV interview.

When Navarro was offered a chance to call an attorney, according to the FBI agents, the defendant noted that he was preparing to proceed without one.

‚ÄúSA Giardina asked, ‚Äòdo you have an attorney you‚Äôd like to call? What is the name of your attorney?‚Äô‚Äù the FBI report says.

According to the report, Navarro replied: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm supposed to be on live television tonight. I‚Äôd like to call the producer and tell him I‚Äôm not going to be there. Can I have my phone?‚Äù

‚ÄúNAVARRO made statements to the effect that the arresting agents were ‚Äòkind Nazis‚Äô and ‚Äòhow could you live with yourselves?‚Äô‚Äù the report adds.

Navarro, in an email, said he‚Äôd made ‚Äúseveral requests‚Äù to call for legal advice when he was arrested.

‚ÄúThis was denied and my phone was confiscated,‚Äù he said.

While some of Navarro‚Äôs allies have claimed he was pulled off an airplane, the report says he was intercepted by the FBI in a jetway at the airport as he prepared to board an American Airlines commuter flight bound for Nashville.

Navarro has also claimed that he was shackled after his arrest. The FBI report mentions handcuffs but no shackles, nor does it address any security practices he might have encountered after he was handed over to deputy U.S. marshals at the courthouse in Washington last Friday.

The Justice Department‚Äôs filing came a day after the department urged the judge in Navarro‚Äôs case, Amit Mehta, to quickly enter a ‚Äúprotective order‚Äù preventing Navarro from disseminating evidence provided to him by prosecutors. Navarro is due in court to be arraigned on the charges on June 17, but he has requested a 45-day delay ‚Äî citing his effort to retain an attorney and to litigate a civil lawsuit against the department and the Jan. 6 select committee. The department said there was no legal basis to delay speedy-trial obligations to accommodate a civil lawsuit.

The department is urging Mehta to reject this request, noting that Navarro still has a week to obtain counsel and that his request for a delay would be disruptive to the case.

The FBI‚Äôs summary of Navarro‚Äôs arrest provides more details about the manner in which he was taken into custody. Navarro, who was accompanied by an unidentified individual, was in the jetway when he was taken into custody at 11:14 a.m., according to the agents. After he was led down the jetway steps, he was handcuffed and his wallet, cellphone and pen were taken and put in a manila envelope, the report indicates.

Navarro was taken to the FBI‚Äôs Washington Field Office for processing, including fingerprinting and a DNA sample, the report says.

After Navarro complained that his handcuffs were causing shoulder pain, they were replaced with a second set and loosened, which the agents said relieved Navarro‚Äôs discomfort. He initially rejected an offer of food, according to the summary, but asked for some at 12:08 p.m. and was given chocolate, nuts and dried fruit. He was later asked whether he wanted anything else to eat and declined, the report says.",1

20,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/06/10/politics/alejandro-mayorkas-interview-cnntv/index.html,"Los Angeles (CNN) The Biden administration has launched an ""unprecedented"" operation to disrupt human smuggling networks amid an ongoing influx of migrants at the US-Mexico border, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas exclusively told CNN.

The operation -- which includes deploying hundreds of personnel throughout Latin America and a multi-million-dollar investment -- comes as the US continues to grapple with a large flow of migrants to the US-Mexico border, including this week as a caravan of up to 5,000 migrants journeys north from southern Mexico.

""We have brought an all-of-government effort to attack the smuggling organizations. It's not just Homeland Security Investigations, it's not just US Customs and Border Protection. But we're working very carefully with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a number of agencies within the Department of Justice, and, of course, our partners in Mexico,"" Mayorkas told CNN.

""I think it's scale and scope; it's tactics and strategy. It's really unprecedented,"" he added.

Mayorkas is attending the Ninth Summit of the Americas, which is being hosted by the United States in Los Angeles. The gathering of nearly two dozen heads of states from the Western Hemisphere has focused on stabilizing the region and investing in it to, in part, stem the flow migration -- an issue that has dogged US presidents, including Joe Biden, for years.

The mass migration within the hemisphere came into sharp focus again this week, as thousands of migrants joined a caravan heading to the US southern border. Asked about how the latest operation applies to that caravan, Mayorkas stressed the administration is ""tackling the smuggling organizations that exploit these people.""

The ""Sting Operation,"" led by the Department of Homeland Security, has so far yielded around 20,000 ""disruption actions"" that include arrests and prosecutions, seizures of property and criminal investigations, according to the department. The US has also surged over 1,300 personnel throughout the Western Hemisphere and invested over $50 million.

In the last eight weeks, nearly 2,000 smugglers have been arrested, marking a 600% increase in law enforcement actions taken against such actors compared to efforts in previous years, DHS said.

The latest operation builds upon previous initiatives by the Biden administration to go after smugglers who migrants often depend on as they make their way to the US-Mexico border. Last spring, DHS also announced an effort to crack down on criminal smuggling organizations, alongside federal partners.

DHS also set up a new intelligence gathering and law enforcement unit to monitor the movement of migrants and helped stand up a task force, led by the Justice Department, to investigate and prosecute human smuggling and trafficking networks.

Migration looms over Summit of the Americas

At the US southern border, a new trend has been taking shape that's posed a challenge to the Biden administration: About 40% of border crossers are now from countries outside of Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.

More than 6 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants have fled the country, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Nicaraguans have also increasingly been migrating, as well as Haitians who had moved to the region years ago.

Over the course of Summit of the Americas, administration officials have acknowledged the mass migration in the Western Hemisphere, stressing the need for all countries to help alleviate the flow and create better conditions in country.

The gathering has served as a platform for the Biden administration, leaders of countries in the region, and the public and private sector to come to agreements about the path forward in stemming the flow of irregular migration.

Biden has aimed to demonstrate a level of cohesion across the two continents' politics, but boycotts by leaders of several nations -- including Mexico and three Central American countries -- has put a damper on the summit.

The four leaders refused to attend because Biden declined to extend invitations to the three autocratic leaders, instead sending lower-level delegations.

Mayorkas dismissed concerns about key leaders skipping the summit, telling CNN: ""All the countries are represented here. So, of course, the president of Mexico is not here but I had the good fortune of seeing the foreign minister of Mexico, Secretary Ebrard, here with whom I have worked very closely throughout my trips to Mexico as well as our continuing dialogue. So no, my confidence is unblemished.""

New funding for stabilization efforts

On Friday, against the backdrop of the Summit of the Americas, Biden announced a regional partnership to address mass migration in the Western Hemisphere. The agreement, dubbed the Los Angeles declaration, was signed onto by 20 Western Hemisphere nations.

The agreement ""is centered around responsibility sharing and economic support for countries that have been most impacted by refugee and migration flows,"" a senior administration official said ahead of Friday's unveiling.

Under the declaration, governments are expected to commit to expanding temporary worker programs, bolstering legal pathways like refugee resettlement and family reunification, providing support to countries hosting large migrant populations, and cracking down on human smuggling networks.

Speaking at an event unveiling the declaration alongside other signatories, Biden said, ""No nation should bear this responsibility alone."" The President also asserted it was on ""every country"" to maintain orderly and human migration process.

""We need to halt the dangerous and unlawful ways that people are migrating,"" he continued. ""Unlawful migration is not acceptable.""

Biden also underscored that human traffickers would not be tolerated, saying, ""If you prey on desperate and vulnerable migrants for profit, we are coming for you.""

The US announced $314 million in new federal funding for ""stabilization efforts in the Americas,"" according to a White House factsheet. Leading up to the Summit of the Americas, administration officials repeatedly stressed the need to support countries in the region who are hosting migrants and refugees, especially Venezuelans who have fled their origin country in large numbers.

The funding is part of a concerted effort to encourage countries throughout the Western Hemisphere to share the responsibility as it relates to migration in the hemisphere and provide opportunity to migrants in hopes of stemming irregular migration.

Colombia and Ecuador, for example, are among the countries providing support to Venezuelans and have committed to providing a path to legal status within their countries for those migrants.

Canada also plans to bolster its efforts by increasing the number of refugees it admits from the Americas to up to 4,000 by 2028. Similarly, the US will resettle 20,000 refugees from the Americas over the next two years, marking an increase from previous years. And Spain will ""double the number of labor pathways for Hondurans,"" the fact sheet says.

While at the summit this week, Biden has stressed economic opportunity in the region and providing jobs, which is reflected in the latest slate of migration commitments.

The US Department of Agriculture announced a pilot program to support US farmers in hiring agricultural workers under existing temporary work visas. Mexico committed to integrating thousands of refugees into the Mexican labor market over the next three years, while Canada said it will take in more than 50,000 agricultural workers from Mexico, Guatemala and the Caribbean this year.

When asked by reporters how the US plans to keep on tabs on the various commitments, a senior administration official said it would be an ""ongoing dialogue.""

22,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/06/09/china-rumors-xi-covid-politics/?itid=mr_world_3,"Placeholder while article actions load

Was Chinese Premier Li Keqiang challenging President Xi Jinping‚Äôs ‚Äúzero covid‚Äù policy when he toured a university in southwestern China without a mask in May? Did Xi briefly disappear from the front page of the Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs official newspaper to quash a rebellion? Is Li making a last-ditch effort to usurp Xi?

Speculation about political infighting and schisms at the top of the Chinese Communist Party are a common feature of its secretive system of appointing new leaders. But this year, political silly season has started early, and the swirl of rumor has been especially intense.

That‚Äôs unsurprising in the buildup to the immensely important, twice-per-decade Party Congress in the fall, which is shaping up to be the most significant transition of power in China since the pro-democracy Tiananmen Square movement in 1989 sparked a messy inter-factional battle for control.

Advertisement

Most close observers of Chinese politics have brushed aside the idea of a fierce battle for power at the top of the party, arguing that Xi‚Äôs hold is so strong that he is near-guaranteed to take on a third term at this year‚Äôs meeting.

What is more unclear is whether the rumors flying around Chinese business circles and overseas Chinese-language media suggest a degree of pushback that will force Xi to compromise on personnel choices and water down some of his more ambitious policy objectives as he enters a third term.

‚ÄúWhat is unusual this time is that China as a whole is doing poorly ahead of a historic Party Congress,‚Äù said Minxin Pei, a political scientist studying Chinese politics at Claremont McKenna College. ‚ÄúIts economy is in terrible shape; the zero-covid policy looks increasingly untenable; and China‚Äôs relations with nearly all Western countries are at historic lows. This of course does not reflect well on Xi.‚Äù

Advertisement

Chinese scholars, however, maintain that nothing is out of the ordinary. Victor Gao, a former interpreter for past leader Deng Xiaoping now at the Center for China and Globalization, a Beijing-based think tank, said in an interview that the rumors are merely part of the cycles of Chinese politics and will soon settle.

Gao did note that this year was particularly important because the transition will include significant turnover in the 25-member Politburo and the 200-odd Central Committee, where he expects new faces for about half of the former and at least a third in the latter. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre talking about changes, lots of changes. People retiring, lots of aspiring people trying to get up, being promoted,‚Äù he said.

To glean a sense of whether Xi‚Äôs rule is under serious pressure, international scholars carefully track promotions and demotions as well as signals in party propaganda. At the center of this informed guesswork ‚Äî often called ‚Äútea leaf reading‚Äù ‚Äî is the question of just how much Xi‚Äôs centralization of control has upended past competition and the delicate balancing of interests within the party.

After Xi‚Äôs decade-long campaigns to clear corruption and ensure loyalty, it‚Äôs unclear whether any cliques remain unified and influential enough to challenge his rule. But that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean Xi is unopposed.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a huge political party, and at the end of the day, Xi Jinping cannot populate all the mid-level positions with trusted followers,‚Äù said Victor Shih, a scholar of Chinese politics at the University of California at San Diego.

In a recent book, Shih argues that autocratic political systems such as China‚Äôs create an incentive for strongman leaders to adopt a strategy of building ‚Äúcoalitions of the weak,‚Äù where politically compromised or inexperienced officials are favored for positions of power as a way of guarding the top leader from challengers.

This, Shih suggests, was the approach Mao Zedong took and Xi may be beginning to adopt. But doing so could mean promoting inexperienced officials incapable of tackling acute economic and foreign policy challenges. Xi faces a trade-off between choosing competent leaders who might later challenge him or taking a ‚Äúsafe route, which is what Mao did, to ultimately have a coalition of officials who are highly dependent on him.‚Äù

The exact processes of power brokering that China calls ‚Äúintraparty democracy‚Äù remain shrouded in secrecy, but it is clear that Xi‚Äôs campaign to end infighting within the party has changed dynamics of internal contestation. Previous features of Chinese political maneuvering, such as an annual visit to the seaside town of Beidaihe, are less prominent, if they now exist at all.

Xi‚Äôs control of the formidable party discipline and ideology apparatuses mean any challenger faces a steep coordination problem to challenge his power. ‚ÄúGetting rid of him would be a very significant political earthquake for the party,‚Äù said Olivia Cheung, a research fellow at SOAS University of London. ‚ÄúNo matter how many of the elite do not like Xi Jinping, there is a consensus that the party wants to stay on in power.‚Äù

Restricted information has made it harder for experts to predict major turning points in Xi‚Äôs tenure. Few predicted the monumental decision to end presidential term limits, announced by Xinhua News in a terse statement only a month before it was voted on at the annual meeting of China‚Äôs legislature in early 2018.

Policymaking, too, has become less transparent under Xi, who has made greater use of ‚Äúcentral leading groups,‚Äù many of which he personally chairs, to centralize control of decision-making. On issues including the pandemic, cybersecurity and curbing debt in the property market, Xi‚Äôs policies have in the last year repeatedly caused market panic, but there have been few signs any of them will be reversed.

Such upsets are rarely blamed on Xi but, rather, on local officials. Shanghai‚Äôs botched lockdown, for example, has not led to a shift in China‚Äôs zero-covid policy, but some analysts believe it may hurt the promotion prospects of Li Qiang, the city‚Äôs party boss and a Xi ally.

Similarly, Li‚Äôs recent prominence, read by some as an indication of a challenge to Xi, can equally well be explained as the premier being intentionally used as a figurehead in charge of resolving deepening economic woes.

A small uptick in Li‚Äôs mentions in state media doesn‚Äôt mean he is ‚Äúsurging back into power,‚Äù said Neil Thomas, an analyst at the Eurasia Group, a think tank. ‚ÄúThis is a way for Xi to make Li the face of economic policy in a year when economic policy is probably going to bring nothing but bad news.‚Äù

Mary Gallagher, a political scientist at the University of Michigan, said that Xi‚Äôs tenure has caused her to revise previous emphasis on China being unusual among authoritarian regimes, because before Xi, the party appeared to be moving toward institutionalized succession with top leaders bowing out after two terms.

‚ÄúHaving this expectation that every decade China‚Äôs leadership would change was really important in making China seem like a stable authoritarian regime,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWithout those institutions in place, it not only makes investors nervous; it makes the next generation of leaders nervous.‚Äù

In an interview with CNBC on Friday, Lam said: ""Looking back, I think the enactment and implementation of a national security law, as well as the subsequent improvements to the electoral system, are absolutely necessary to ensure Hong Kong's continuous stability and prosperity."" ""And if I may just add, stability is extremely important for Hong Kong to maintain and enhance status as an international financial center,"" Hong Kong's chief executive told CNBC's Emily Tan and Martin Soong. Lam also said the exodus of expatriates and foreigners from Hong Kong in recent months was not due to the newly enacted national security law ‚Äî seen by some as Beijing's tightening of its grip over the city ‚Äî but as a result of the the strict pandemic controls and measures that ""make people very impatient.""

""Sometimes you need the difficult situations [protests] to weaken people, this is something that we needed to do. The enactment of the national security law and subsequent improvements to increase stability,"" Lam said on CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia."" ""Stability is important to maintain enhanced Hong Kong as a financial center. Now that stability has been assured."" Hong Kong's national security law came into effect on June 30, 2020, before midnight on the eve of Hong Kong's July 1 anniversary marking its handover from British to Chinese rule. The city was gripped by months of protests ahead of the controversial law aimed at prohibiting secession, subversion of state power, terrorism activities and foreign interference.

'One country, two systems'

After the reunification of Hong Kong with mainland China in 1997, laws were put in place to guarantee the practice of ""one country, two systems"" principle for 50 years ‚Äî or until 2047. That framework makes Hong Kong a special administrative region of China but with limited election rights and a mostly separate legal and economic system.

When people complain there's no freedom, this is not the situation in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is as free as ever. Carrie Lam Hong Kong chief executive

Lam insisted that Hong Kong's freedoms and autonomy remained intact and had not expired ahead of 2047, despite propaganda pushed by some Western media outlets. ""I sometimes find it very disturbing that a lot of Western media try to portray Hong Kong as just another Chinese city and have no proper recognition or understanding of 'one country, two systems,'"" she said. She said mainland Chinese officials believed that the ""one country, two systems"" principle was the ""best institutional arrangement to ensure Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.""

Alongside Beijing, Lam said she looked forward to the ""continuation of what is in the Basic Law, including the upholding of the individual rights and freedoms, the practice of Hong Kong's capitalist system, and all the high degree of autonomy that has been given to Hong Kong."" ""When people complain there's no freedom, this is not the situation in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is as free as ever, whether it's in the freedom of expression, in the freedom of assembly, in the media, and so on.""

National security law

Despite the protests and riots, the implementation of the national security law and the earlier extradition bill were needed for Hong Kong to find its feet around the right laws to protect national interests, Lam said. She said this was crucial as Hong Kong had yet to establish its own institutions and legal systems to protect national interests, security and sovereignty more than two decades after the handover to China.

Freedoms are not absolute. Freedoms have to be sort of restrained, where there is a public interest. And no public interest could be more superior than national interest. Carrie Lam Hong Kong chief executive

Growing pains were part of this emancipation as seen with other protests before 2019, including the 79-day Occupy Central movement in 2014 when demonstrators demanded direct, universal suffrage to select the city's leader, Lam said. ""Freedoms are not absolute,"" Lam told CNBC. ""Freedoms have to be sort of restrained, where there is a public interest. And no public interest could be more superior than national interest."" ""So every place should have rules and laws in place to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests of the nation. Before the enactment of the national security law, Hong Kong was a vacuum insofar as those institutions and laws are concerned.""

On Covid and sanctions

Ahead of the two-year anniversary of the enactment of the national security law, the city continues to suffer increasing departures of foreign talent and international operations, but Lam said it was a temporary blip. Hong Kong's resilience is on full display with the number of people traveling to the city on the rise since the relaxation of quarantine periods to one week and the lifting of the ban on travelers from nine countries including the UK and the U.S. on April 1, Lam said. Daily arrivals at Hong Kong international airport multiplied ten-fold to 3,000 a day compared to 300 when the full suite of restrictions were in place before April, according to Lam.

... in order to perform our duty of loyalty, we must not be intimidated ‚Äî whether it is by abuse, by force, by sanctions or other means. Carrie Lam Hong Kong chief executive

Hong Kong's strict Covid-19 containment strategies were needed to protect Hong Kong's key travel corridor into the mainland, Lam said, but denied they were just a copy of the mainland's China's zero-Covid approach that has led to entire cities such as Shanghai shut down and economically crippled. ""The Hong Kong SAR government has a high degree of autonomy in determining how to tackle a public health crisis. But the reality is, our people need to travel to the mainland, but at the same time, we need a very strong international connectivity,"" she said. ""That's why throughout the last two and half years, we have been trying to strike a balance that will enable us to meet both objectives.""",1

Speaking to the Independent newspaper Thursday, Fauci again suggested he will retire: ‚ÄúYou know, to be honest with you, I certainly will some time, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to be a very long time from now.‚Äù

Save on MyPillow products. Use promo code FedUp at checkout and save 50% on all MyPillow Down Comforters.

Without giving more details, Fauci said that he has not ‚Äúreally focused on exactly what that would be, because we‚Äôre sort of in the middle of a public health crisis,‚Äù adding that COVID-19 has to be under ‚Äúbetter control.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt specify what measures could be taken to further control the virus.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not trying to be evasive,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt might be sooner than most people think, or it might be later than most people think.‚Äù

Fauci has worked for the federal government for over 50 years. While he is most well-known for spearheading the response to Covid-19, Fauci also reportedly conducted horrifying experiments on orphaned childrens while researching a treatment for AIDS.

In a book by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. titled ‚ÄúThe Real Anthony Fauci‚Äù, he reveals that reporter Cecilia Farber found a mass grave containing tiny coffins for young children. Kennedy alleges that the graves are from orphaned children who died from Fauci‚Äôs experiments.

While Fauci‚Äôs retirement is undoubtedly good for the country, it is tragic that he will get to collect a government pension and never be held accountable for his sickening crimes.",1

The last few days in the United States have seen a parade of wealthy freaks fellating each other‚Äôs egos and preening for the cameras in outlandish garb while ordinary Americans suffer more and more.

The weekend‚Äôs White House Correspondents‚Äô Dinner saw a gaggle of media celebrities congregate to congratulate one another on what a great job they‚Äôve been doing bravely telling the truth and holding the most powerful government on earth to account. The host, Trevor Noah of The Daily Show, gushed with enthusiasm about how much freedom the press have in America to say things the powerful don‚Äôt like.

I‚Äôve always respected @Trevornoah so much but this closing speech from the White House correspondents‚Äô dinner is particularly spectacular. pic.twitter.com/k8GmBOAoYB ‚Äî Mike Birbiglia (@birbigs) May 1, 2022

‚ÄúAs we sit in this room tonight, people, I really hope you all remember what the real purpose of this evening is,‚Äù Noah said. ‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs fun. Yes, we dress nice. Yes, the people eat, they drink, we have fun. But the reason we‚Äôre here is to honor and celebrate the fourth estates and what you stand for ‚Äî what you stand for ‚Äî an additional check and balance that holds power to account and gives voice to those who otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have one.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd if you ever begin to doubt your responsibilities, if you ever begin to doubt how meaningful it is, look no further than what‚Äôs happening in Ukraine,‚Äù said Noah. ‚ÄúLook at what‚Äôs happening there. Journalists are risking and even losing their lives to show the world what‚Äôs really happening. You realize how amazing it is. In America, you have the right to seek the truth and speak the truth even if it makes people in power uncomfortable, even if it makes your viewers or your readers uncomfortable. You understand how amazing that is? I stood here tonight and I made fun of the president of the United States, and I‚Äôm going to be fine. I am going to be fine, right? Do you really understand what a blessing it is?‚Äù

Of course there are people who‚Äôve said things that US presidents don‚Äôt like who are not in fact fine. Julian Assange continues to waste away in Belmarsh Prison as the US government continues its efforts to extradite him to he can become the first publisher ever tried under the Espionage Act. Edward Snowden, an American, remains in exile because one US president after another continues to refuse to pardon his heroic whistleblowing about the sinister surveillance practices of the US intelligence cartel. Daniel Hale, also an American, sits in prison for exposing the depravity of America‚Äôs monstrous drone program.

Trevor Noah: ""In the US you have the right to speak the truth even if it makes the people in power uncomfortable."" In 2021 Daniel Hale was sentenced to 45 months in prison for exposing that in Afghanistan, 90% of the victims of US airstrikes were civilians. https://t.co/rs4i0wPPSU ‚Äî Friendly Neighborhood Comrade (@SpiritofLenin) May 2, 2022

Trevor Noah did not mention these people, or the many others who‚Äôve been persecuted, silenced, imprisoned and killed for saying things the powerful individuals who govern the US don‚Äôt approve of, because as a member of the mainstream media his job is not to inform but to propagandize.

Far from providing ‚Äúan additional check and balance that holds power to account and gives voice to those who otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have one‚Äù as Noah claims, the people in his audience on Saturday night are tasked with manipulating public thought in facilitation of the interests of the powerful. The mainstream news media in America, and throughout all the so-called free democracies of the western world, are propaganda institutions whose first and foremost job is to manufacture consent for oligarchy and empire.

Which is why the President of the United States, when he took the podium that night, had nothing but friendly words for the mainstream press.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs clear, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, is that you, the free press, matter more than you ever did in the last century,‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve all seen the courage of Ukrainian people because of the courage of American reporters in this room, and your colleagues across the world who are on the ground taking their lives in their own hands.‚Äù

Congratulations to US journalists for doing nothing but produce coverage that the White House absolutely loves https://t.co/ToTnPZBlXs ‚Äî Michael Tracey (@mtracey) May 1, 2022

This past weekend also saw a friendly gathering of brave fourth estate truth warriors and political and government operatives of the US empire at a party hosted by the billionaire owner of the neocon war propaganda rag The Atlantic.

The orgy of embarrassment was capped off by the 2022 Met Gala, a big weird dystopian parade of rich freaks dressed like Hunger Games aristocracy and laughing in the face of everyone who can‚Äôt afford to live.

An honest Met Gala dress would have a corset made from the bones of Yemeni children, draped with a cloth of stolen gold and lithium spun by the tiny hands of child slaves, with a full-length train that leached oil and blood wherever it went.

This while ordinary Americans struggle just to survive. While American women appear to be on the precipice of losing their reproductive sovereignty. While money is poured into a proxy war which threatens to escalate into a conflict that could easily end all life on earth.

This is your dying empire, America. This is your end-stage capitalism. This is your dystopia, in all its weird, phony, stupid glory.

It is horrifying. The longer you look at it, the creepier it gets.

26,https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/10/chesa-boudin-progressive-agenda-california-00038675,"But despite the resounding rejection of Boudin, Tuesday‚Äôs results beyond San Francisco suggest voters are willing to reconsider, but not abandon, how their state handles crime and punishment.

‚ÄúWhat happens in San Francisco says more about San Francisco than even the rest of the Bay, never mind the 40 million people in the rest of California,‚Äù said Ludovic Blain, who heads a progressive fundraising network called California Donor Table, pointing to Attorney General Rob Bonta‚Äôs strong showing.

Restiveness about public safety laid the foundation for Boudin‚Äôs ouster. The district attorney‚Äôs foes poured millions of dollars into the campaign that argued he had undermined public order by refusing to prosecute serious crimes ‚Äî and they enlisted disillusioned former prosecutors from his office to make the case.

The result reverberated far beyond the liberal city. National Republicans were quick to predict broader fallout for Democrats after the San Francisco results rolled in. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) urged the defeat of ‚Äúevery single Soros prosecutor‚Äù ‚Äî a reference to the billionaire George Soros funding district attorney campaigns around the country, including in California ‚Äî and backed a baseless rumor that President Joe Biden might tap Boudin for an administration job. Biden himself said Tuesday‚Äôs elections underscored voters‚Äô desire for elected officials to ‚Äústep up and do something about crime.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt turns out it was a political mistake for the entire Democrat party to spend years coddling criminals. Voters will get another chance to voice their displeasure with Democrats‚Äô pro-crime agenda in November,‚Äù a National Republican Campaign Committee spokesperson, Mike Berg, said in a statement after Boudin‚Äôs defeat.

But while Boudin‚Äôs defeat was interpreted outside of San Francisco as a rebuke of the criminal justice reform movement he embodied, San Francisco Democrats took a more nuanced view: This was about specific grievances with Boudin himself, not a return to harsh sentences and mass incarceration. San Francisco Mayor London Breed, who did not take a position on the race but has publicly clashed with Boudin, told reporters on Wednesday that the outcome ‚Äúdoes not mean that criminal justice reform in San Francisco is going anywhere.‚Äù

Recall leader and former San Francisco Democratic Party head Mary Jung said in a statement after Boudin‚Äôs defeat: ‚ÄúSan Francisco voters are engaged and well-informed. They know that we can have important criminal justice reforms and public safety for all, but that neither was being achieved with Chesa in office.‚Äù

The vote to recall Boudin was far more decisive than the vote to elect him in the first place. Boudin prevailed in 2019 after multiple rounds of San Francisco‚Äôs ranked-choice system, narrowly beating out an incumbent whom Breed had appointed to the open seat shortly before the election. That meant he started without a clear voter mandate, leaving space for well-organized and well-funded moderate foes.

The race assumed national proportions from the start. Boudin‚Äôs backers warned that a successful recall campaign would offer a blueprint for the rest of the country: spend money to fan fears about crime and force left-leaning district attorneys out of office. That model could be especially effective as a spike in violent crime has left much of the public on edge. State legislatures in Pennsylvania and Illinois have already moved to try to allow the recalls of liberal prosecutors.

Yet reformers have counterexamples from which to take heart. Progressive Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner surmounted a challenge last year despite surging homicides and heavy police opposition. Progressive attorney Kimberly Graham advanced on Tuesday in her bid to become the prosecutor for Iowa‚Äôs largest county. And in 2020, Californians voted to preserve an earlier ballot initiative that reduced property crime penalties and allowed earlier parole ‚Äî the types of changes that have become fiercely contested in San Francisco and beyond.

‚ÄúSan Francisco voters are engaged and well-informed. They know that we can have important criminal justice reforms and public safety for all, but that neither was being achieved with Chesa in office.‚Äù San Francisco Democratic Party head Mary Jung

As Boudin was delivering his concession speech, another Bay Area district attorney, Diana Becton, rebuffed a law-enforcement-backed challenge in nearby Contra Costa County after having convicted a former sheriff‚Äôs deputy of assault with a firearm for fatally shooting a suspect while on duty. Reform funders spent heavily to defend her. And Pamela Price, another progressive candidate on Tuesday‚Äôs ballot, carved out a plurality in Alameda County, home to Oakland, and is bound for a runoff.

‚ÄúI am moving away from the singular reliance on incarceration as the solution to everything, and I think what‚Äôs happened in so many places in these types of races, when you have a progressive-minded prosecutor, is people are being asked to make a false choice about what public safety means,‚Äù Becton said in an interview. ‚ÄúWe are in this for the long haul,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúIt is a movement, like the civil rights movement, and there are some leaders who may fall but we continue to rise.‚Äù

Nearly 55 percent of voters statewide ‚Äî and nearly three-quarters of San Francisco voters ‚Äî cast their ballots for Bonta, California‚Äôs progressive attorney general, giving him a comfortable lead that could preview a November win. Sacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert ‚Äî an unaffiliated candidate who spent months trying to link Bonta to Boudin, assailing Bonta for plunging the state into ‚Äúchaos‚Äù ‚Äî is languishing in fourth place. She was far behind Bonta even in her home county of Sacramento.

Voters did rebuke liberal contenders elsewhere: In California‚Äôs Central Valley, San Joaquin District Attorney Tori Verber Salazar, a member of a formal progressive group with Boudin that‚Äôs intended as a counterweight to more traditional prosecutors, was losing to a challenger. Orange County‚Äôs Republican district attorney, Todd Spitzer, crushed a Democratic opponent who had highlighted controversies like allegations that Spitzer had displayed racial bias. Sacramento prosecutor Thien Ho defeated progressive opponent Alana Mathews for Schubert‚Äôs job.

In Los Angeles, where progressive District Attorney George Gasc√≥n also faces the threat of a recall election, billionaire ex-Republican mayoral candidate Rick Caruso vaulted past Democratic Rep. Karen Bass into first place after spending tens of millions of dollars promising to restore a sense of public safety and ‚Äúclean up‚Äù homeless encampments in California‚Äôs largest city. But Caruso didn‚Äôt net enough votes to win outright, as his supporters had hoped. Instead, he will face Bass in a November runoff, which is likely to draw younger and more progressive voters.

And LA‚Äôs Democratic sheriff, who rankled his party by taking a tough line on crime and becoming a fixture on Fox News panels excoriating progressive law enforcement, failed to win a second term outright. Sheriff Alex Villanueva is headed to a runoff, where he will likely face a party-backed challenger.

Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles and an expert in campaign ethics and elections, said Tuesday‚Äôs election shows the limits of tough-on-crime messaging‚Äôs appeal. And she argued it was not a stark dichotomy: Even though Caruso was painted as the conservative, tough-on-crime candidate, Bass herself also took an approach that some felt wasn‚Äôt progressive enough ‚Äî promising to add more police to the streets and declare a homeless emergency on her first day in office, both things that Caruso has also vowed to do.

‚ÄúIn a way, we can read what happened with respect to Caruso and Bass as demonstrating that protecting the public, and being tough on crime isn‚Äôt the number one thing in the public‚Äôs mind,‚Äù Levinson said.

Foes of Gasc√≥n ‚Äî Boudin‚Äôs predecessor and a staunch ally ‚Äî are racing to gather enough signatures to trigger a November recall in Los Angeles. Like Boudin, Gasc√≥n has faced an internal revolt as deputy prosecutors took him to court over directives dramatically easing sentencing. Gasc√≥n has modified some of those orders.

A spokesperson for the Gasc√≥n recall, Tim Lineberger, argued that San Francisco‚Äôs ‚Äúresounding rejection of pro-criminal policies that have been masked as criminal justice reform‚Äù foretold a difficult path for Gasc√≥n. Lineberger also said reformers pointing to positive signs from Tuesday‚Äôs votes were ‚Äúgrasping at straws here because it was a bloodbath for them.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat you did see was a district attorney, who has the same policies as that of Los Angeles, be rejected wholesale by some of the most progressive voters in the country, because they disagree with what he calls reform,‚Äù Lineberger said.

Supporters of Boudin and the movement he embodies point to the unique characteristics of his race: a recall that was an up-or-down test of his record, a city on edge after a pandemic in which homicides and some property crimes initially surged, and a wave of outside spending. But they acknowledge that pervasive public pessimism introduces a genuine challenge.

‚ÄúThere are so many aspects of a heavily funded, low-voter-turnout race where voters weren‚Äôt making a choice but were simply provided an opportunity to vent frustration and fear, that I‚Äôm not sure how much one can really take from that,‚Äù said Miriam Krinsky, the executive director of the organization Fair and Just Prosecution. ‚ÄúI do think we need to grapple with the fact that there is a lot of anxiety out there, that people are worried about crime statistics, and that cannot and should not be ignored ‚Äî but I think the question is how do we make communities safer and stronger.‚Äù

One person with an optimistic take on Tuesday‚Äôs results: Boudin himself. Seemingly unfazed by his defeat, Boudin delivered a fiery speech to a crowd of supporters in San Francisco, leading them in chants of ‚ÄúOur cause is righteous! And we have already won!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have already won because we are part of a national movement that recognizes we can never incarcerate our way out of poverty,‚Äù Boudin said, adding that ‚Äúthe movement that got us elected in 2019 is alive and well.‚Äù",0

The Covid-19 pandemic has abated in much of the world and, with it, many of the social restrictions implemented to curb its spread, as people have been eager to return to pre-lockdown life. But in its place have emerged a series of viruses behaving in new and peculiar ways. Take seasonal influenza, more commonly known as the flu. The 2020 and 2021 U.S. winter flu seasons were some of the mildest on record both in terms of deaths and hospitalizations. Yet cases ticked up in February and climbed further into the spring and summer as Covid restrictions were stripped back. ""We've never seen a flu season in the U.S. extend into June,"" Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director for infection prevention at Yale New Haven Hospital, told CNBC Tuesday. ""Covid has clearly had a very big impact on that. Now that people have unmasked, places are opening up, we're seeing viruses behave in very odd ways that they weren't before,"" he said. And flu is just the beginning.

We are seeing very atypical behaviors in a number of ways for a number of viruses. Dr Scott Roberts associate medical director for infection prevention, Yale New Haven Hospital

Respiratory syncytial virus, a cold-like virus common during winter months, exhibited an uptick last summer, with cases surging among children in Europe, the U.S and Japan. Then, in January this year, an outbreak of adenovirus 41, usually responsible for gastrointestinal illness, became the apparent cause of a mysterious and severe liver disease among young children. Elsewhere, Washington State has been experiencing its worst flare-up of tuberculosis in 20 years. And now, a recent outbreak of monkeypox, a rare viral infection typically found in Central and West Africa, is baffling health experts with over 1,000 confirmed and suspected cases emerging in 29 non-endemic countries.

Viruses behaving badly

At least two genetically distinct monkeypox variants are now circulating in the U.S., likely stemming from two different spillover infections from animals to humans, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week. The World Health Organization noted earlier last week that the virus, whose symptoms include fever and skin lesions, may have been going undetected in society for ""months or possibly a couple of years.""

""The two strains probably indicate this has been going on longer than we first thought. We're at a concerning time right now,"" said Roberts. He noted that the coming weeks will be telling for the course of the virus, which has an incubation period of 5 to 21 days. It is not yet clear whether the smallpox-like virus has mutated, though health experts have reported that it is behaving in new and atypical ways. Most notably, it appears to be spreading within the community ‚Äî most commonly through sex ‚Äî as opposed to via travel from places where it is typically found. Symptoms are also appearing in new ways. ""Patients are presenting differently than we were previously taught,"" said Roberts, noting that some infected patients are bypassing initial flu-like symptoms and immediately developing rashes and lesions, specifically and unusually on the genitals and anus. ""There's a lot of unknowns that do make me uneasy. We are seeing very atypical behaviors in a number of ways for a number of viruses,"" he said.

Restrictions reduce exposure, immunity

One explanation, of course, is that Covid-induced restrictions and mask-wearing over the past two years have given other infectious diseases little opportunity to spread in the ways they once did. Where viruses did manage to slip through, they were frequently missed as public health surveillance centered largely on the pandemic. That indeed was the case in Washington's tuberculosis outbreak, according to local health authorities, who said parallels between the two illnesses allowed TB cases to go undiagnosed.

During the Covid pandemic, access to primary care, including childhood vaccinations, was unavailable to many children. Jennifer Horney professor of epidemiology, University of Delaware

Now, as pandemic-induced restrictions have eased and usual habits resumed, viruses that were in retreat have found a fertile breeding ground in newly social and travel-hungry hosts. The recent monkeypox outbreak is thought to have stemmed, at least in part, from two mass events in Europe, a lead adviser to the WHO said last month. Meantime, two years of reduced exposure have lowered individual immunity to diseases and made society as a whole more vulnerable. That is especially true for young children ‚Äî typically germ amplifiers ‚Äî who missed opportunities to gain antibodies against common viruses, either through their mother's womb or early years socializing.

Missed childhood vaccinations

That could explain the uptick in curious severe acute hepatitis cases among children, according to health experts who are looking into possible links to Covid restrictions. ""We are also exploring whether increased susceptibility due to reduced exposure during the Covid-19 pandemic could be playing a role,"" the U.K. Health Security Agency said in April.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also expressed concern that lockdowns may have caused many children to miss childhood vaccinations, potentially raising the risks of other vaccine-preventable illnesses such as measles and pertussis. ""During the Covid pandemic, access to primary care, including childhood vaccinations, was unavailable to many children,"" Jennifer Horney, professor of epidemiology at the University of Delaware, told CNBC. ""To prevent increases in these diseases, catch-up vaccination campaigns are needed globally,"" she added.

Beware surveillance bias

That said, there is also now greater awareness and surveillance of public health issues in the wake of the pandemic, making diagnoses of some outbreaks more commonplace. ""Covid has raised the profile of public health matters so that we are perhaps paying more attention to these events when they occur,"" said Horney, adding that public health systems set up to identify Covid have also helped diagnose other diseases. Professor Eyal Leshem, infectious disease specialist at Sheba Medical Center, agreed: ""The general population and the media have become much more interested in zoonotic outbreaks and infectious diseases.""

Was Chinese Premier Li Keqiang challenging President Xi Jinping‚Äôs ‚Äúzero covid‚Äù policy when he toured a university in southwestern China without a mask in May? Did Xi briefly disappear from the front page of the Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs official newspaper to quash a rebellion? Is Li making a last-ditch effort to usurp Xi?

Speculation about political infighting and schisms at the top of the Chinese Communist Party are a common feature of its secretive system of appointing new leaders. But this year, political silly season has started early, and the swirl of rumor has been especially intense.

That‚Äôs unsurprising in the buildup to the immensely important, twice-per-decade Party Congress in the fall, which is shaping up to be the most significant transition of power in China since the pro-democracy Tiananmen Square movement in 1989 sparked a messy inter-factional battle for control.

Most close observers of Chinese politics have brushed aside the idea of a fierce battle for power at the top of the party, arguing that Xi‚Äôs hold is so strong that he is near-guaranteed to take on a third term at this year‚Äôs meeting.

What is more unclear is whether the rumors flying around Chinese business circles and overseas Chinese-language media suggest a degree of pushback that will force Xi to compromise on personnel choices and water down some of his more ambitious policy objectives as he enters a third term.

‚ÄúWhat is unusual this time is that China as a whole is doing poorly ahead of a historic Party Congress,‚Äù said Minxin Pei, a political scientist studying Chinese politics at Claremont McKenna College. ‚ÄúIts economy is in terrible shape; the zero-covid policy looks increasingly untenable; and China‚Äôs relations with nearly all Western countries are at historic lows. This of course does not reflect well on Xi.‚Äù

Advertisement

Chinese scholars, however, maintain that nothing is out of the ordinary. Victor Gao, a former interpreter for past leader Deng Xiaoping now at the Center for China and Globalization, a Beijing-based think tank, said in an interview that the rumors are merely part of the cycles of Chinese politics and will soon settle.

Gao did note that this year was particularly important because the transition will include significant turnover in the 25-member Politburo and the 200-odd Central Committee, where he expects new faces for about half of the former and at least a third in the latter. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre talking about changes, lots of changes. People retiring, lots of aspiring people trying to get up, being promoted,‚Äù he said.

To glean a sense of whether Xi‚Äôs rule is under serious pressure, international scholars carefully track promotions and demotions as well as signals in party propaganda. At the center of this informed guesswork ‚Äî often called ‚Äútea leaf reading‚Äù ‚Äî is the question of just how much Xi‚Äôs centralization of control has upended past competition and the delicate balancing of interests within the party.

After Xi‚Äôs decade-long campaigns to clear corruption and ensure loyalty, it‚Äôs unclear whether any cliques remain unified and influential enough to challenge his rule. But that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean Xi is unopposed.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a huge political party, and at the end of the day, Xi Jinping cannot populate all the mid-level positions with trusted followers,‚Äù said Victor Shih, a scholar of Chinese politics at the University of California at San Diego.

In a recent book, Shih argues that autocratic political systems such as China‚Äôs create an incentive for strongman leaders to adopt a strategy of building ‚Äúcoalitions of the weak,‚Äù where politically compromised or inexperienced officials are favored for positions of power as a way of guarding the top leader from challengers.

This, Shih suggests, was the approach Mao Zedong took and Xi may be beginning to adopt. But doing so could mean promoting inexperienced officials incapable of tackling acute economic and foreign policy challenges. Xi faces a trade-off between choosing competent leaders who might later challenge him or taking a ‚Äúsafe route, which is what Mao did, to ultimately have a coalition of officials who are highly dependent on him.‚Äù

The exact processes of power brokering that China calls ‚Äúintraparty democracy‚Äù remain shrouded in secrecy, but it is clear that Xi‚Äôs campaign to end infighting within the party has changed dynamics of internal contestation. Previous features of Chinese political maneuvering, such as an annual visit to the seaside town of Beidaihe, are less prominent, if they now exist at all.

Xi‚Äôs control of the formidable party discipline and ideology apparatuses mean any challenger faces a steep coordination problem to challenge his power. ‚ÄúGetting rid of him would be a very significant political earthquake for the party,‚Äù said Olivia Cheung, a research fellow at SOAS University of London. ‚ÄúNo matter how many of the elite do not like Xi Jinping, there is a consensus that the party wants to stay on in power.‚Äù

Restricted information has made it harder for experts to predict major turning points in Xi‚Äôs tenure. Few predicted the monumental decision to end presidential term limits, announced by Xinhua News in a terse statement only a month before it was voted on at the annual meeting of China‚Äôs legislature in early 2018.

Policymaking, too, has become less transparent under Xi, who has made greater use of ‚Äúcentral leading groups,‚Äù many of which he personally chairs, to centralize control of decision-making. On issues including the pandemic, cybersecurity and curbing debt in the property market, Xi‚Äôs policies have in the last year repeatedly caused market panic, but there have been few signs any of them will be reversed.

Such upsets are rarely blamed on Xi but, rather, on local officials. Shanghai‚Äôs botched lockdown, for example, has not led to a shift in China‚Äôs zero-covid policy, but some analysts believe it may hurt the promotion prospects of Li Qiang, the city‚Äôs party boss and a Xi ally.

Similarly, Li‚Äôs recent prominence, read by some as an indication of a challenge to Xi, can equally well be explained as the premier being intentionally used as a figurehead in charge of resolving deepening economic woes.

A small uptick in Li‚Äôs mentions in state media doesn‚Äôt mean he is ‚Äúsurging back into power,‚Äù said Neil Thomas, an analyst at the Eurasia Group, a think tank. ‚ÄúThis is a way for Xi to make Li the face of economic policy in a year when economic policy is probably going to bring nothing but bad news.‚Äù

Mary Gallagher, a political scientist at the University of Michigan, said that Xi‚Äôs tenure has caused her to revise previous emphasis on China being unusual among authoritarian regimes, because before Xi, the party appeared to be moving toward institutionalized succession with top leaders bowing out after two terms.

‚ÄúHaving this expectation that every decade China‚Äôs leadership would change was really important in making China seem like a stable authoritarian regime,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWithout those institutions in place, it not only makes investors nervous; it makes the next generation of leaders nervous.‚Äù

As the media hypes gun control and abortion debates, bankers, politicians, military leaders, and information controllers will be discussing their plans for the world behind closed doors and with zero transparency.

The 68th annual Bilderberg Meeting, which has been held in locations around the world throughout the years, kicked off on Thursday in Washington D.C. with absolutely no press coverage at all and is set to end on Sunday June 5. Despite a prestigious guest list of around 120 attendees ‚Äî who will arguably have more of a global influence than any elected officials ‚Äî the meeting will escape any scrutiny in the mainstream media.

The reason this meeting of the global elite manages to remain free from any mainstream media coverage is no accident. This group of elite power brokers owns the media, they own the politicians, and, arguably, they own the world.

In attendance to this year‚Äôs meeting are war criminals like Henry Kissinger, Albert Bourla the CEO of criminal pharmaceutical company Pfizer, Head of the CIA William J Burns, the Secretary General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, GlaxoSmithKline CEO Emma Walmsley, Eric Schmidt the infamous former CEO of Google, and other heads of corporate media, foreign heads of state, and military officials.

According to the elite group of power brokers made up of people who forced vaccines, lockdowns, and tyranny on the entire planet for the last two years, the key topics for discussion this year at their secret event are:

1. Geopolitical Realignments

2. NATO Challenges

3. China

4. Indo-Pacific Realignment

5. Sino-US Tech Competition

6. Russia

7. Continuity of Government and the Economy

8. Disruption of the Global Financial System

9. Disinformation

10. Energy Security and Sustainability

11. Post Pandemic Health

12. Fragmentation of Democratic Societies

13. Trade and Deglobalisation

14. Ukraine

Nothing sinister at all about some of the largest purveyors of disinformation in the world meeting in secret to discuss possible world war with China and Russia, while plotting how to silence speech they consider ‚Äúdisinformation.‚Äù

In what many would call a violation of the United States Logan Act, Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema will be in attendance. Sinema is a Democrat turned independent currently working with both Democrats and Republicans to push through gun control. She has openly expressed her support for the late warmonger John McCain and has repeatedly pushed for escalation in Ukraine.

As we‚Äôve reported, former presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton both attended Bilderberg conferences in the years before being elected to the Oval Office. Tony Blair was on hand at the 1993 Bilderberg meeting before becoming prime minister of England in 1997, and Emmanuel Macron, the President of France attended in 2014 just prior to being elected.

What‚Äôs more, the 2008 conference is believed to be the catalyst for that year‚Äôs US presidential election: rumors suggest that attendees settling on backing Barack Obama for the Democratic Party nomination at that year‚Äôs event, only for contender Hillary Clinton to bow out two days later.

Bilderberg attendees must abide by Chatham House Rules, meaning that while participants can use the information received, they are barred from talking about any individual who may have steered their decisions.

Numerous bloggers and activists have suggested that, based just on what is known already from public statements, simply attending a Bilderberg meeting should constitute sufficient grounds for immediate arrest and investigation of Americans.

In 2011, then-Congressman Ron Paul called for an investigation and noted that U.S. officials participating in the yearly gathering ‚Äî specifically Texas Gov. Rick Perry at the time ‚Äî were quite possibly breaking the law. ‚ÄúThis information about him going over there and violating the Logan Act and getting involved, I‚Äôm just impressed that that‚Äôs in the ordinary media ‚Äî I think that‚Äôs encouraging, too,‚Äù Paul said during an interview at the time, noting that Gov. Perry‚Äôs attendance was ‚Äúa sign that he‚Äôs involved in the international conspiracy.‚Äù

Paul is not simply making this up either, the Logan Act clearly states, in part:

‚ÄúAny citizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.‚Äù

To illustrate the scope of the group‚Äôs reach, Business Insider published a chart, showing all their ominous connections.

But fret not free world, you can still watch reruns of the Johnny Depp trial on TikTok.

This misinformation thing needs to be stopped. Not only this is total censorship but this literally gives governments unimaginable tyrannical powers of propaganda and control. This needs to be put to end NOW before it continues to spread. This is nonsense. Turkey wants to throw people in jail over ‚Äúspreading misinformation‚Äù? What is ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù in the first place? Who is the master of truth? Who defines what is real and what is false? Why your government of course.

If your government decides to say ‚ÄúNo Turkey was never an empire, we never oppressed anyone. The Ottoman empire was a different entity.‚Äù and you say, but WE WERE the Ottomans. It was us, not others, not Africans, not Persians, us, here, we Turks, were were the Ottomans.

Well this right here could be ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù and you could be thrown in jail for this. Additionally someone with A FREAKING OPINION about anything could be labled ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù, like ‚ÄúI believe today will not rain even though weather channels say it will rain.‚Äù There you go: Misinformation! Jail time for you!

This is fucking insane. People who even propose such laws should be jailed before their vile ideas materialize into reality. Humanity exists for thousands of years yet we never had such insane laws ‚ÄúCensorship and jail for misinformation.‚Äù This is only a recent thing, a product of insanity that was given birth in USA specifically by Donald Trump. Trump was the one who invented this crap as he began calling the mainstream media ‚ÄúFake News‚Äù and from this it has evolved into this ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù we have today and it has spread to all corners of the world. We‚Äôve gotten to the point of Turkey jailing people over expressing their ‚Äúwrong‚Äù opinions.

Imagine this‚Ä¶ this is a perfect law any dictator wants in its arsenal. A law that says jail over misinformation‚Ä¶ what the hell? We need to make a stand and destroy this idea of ‚Äúgovernment punishment over misinformation.‚Äù

Even writing an op-ed or telling a joke, anything could be interpreted as a misinformation. This is bollocks, what they want is to basically: do not deviate from party lines or else.

Give misinformation laws to China.

A Chinese says: My government is sending Uyghurs to concentration camps.

China: NOT TRUE! JAIL FOR YOU!

Give misinformation laws to Iran.

An Iranian says: Life in Iran was better under the Shah and with USA as a partner.

Iran: NOT TRUE! JAIL FOR YOU!

Give misinformation laws to Israel.

An Israelil says: Maybe we should stop occupying West Bank lands. We already took too much.

Israel: NOT TRUE! WE NEVER STOLE ANY LANDS! JAIL FOR YOU!

Give misinformation laws to Canada.

A Canadian says: The truckers were right to protest the vaccination laws. They were oppressive and vaccination should be a CHOICE WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES! Besides COVID is not as dangerous as they say, it only has a death rate of below 1%.

Canadian authorities: NOT TRUE! JAIL FOR YOU!

This is insane! We must put an end to ‚Äúmisinformation laws‚Äù. This is not even censorship. This is simply tyranny.

Infowars report:

The Turkish government introduced a new law in parliament that will give the government more control over the internet. The law was drafted by President‚Äôs Recep Tayyip Erdogan‚Äôs Justice and Development Party (AKP) and its ally the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP).

The law, which is expected to pass, will punish ‚Äúspreading misinformation on purpose.‚Äù It prohibits publicly spreading ‚Äúfalse information regarding internal and external security, public order and the general health of the country, in a way that is suitable for disturbing the public peace, simply for the purpose of creating anxiety, fear or panic among the people.‚Äù

The punishment for intentionally spreading ‚Äúfalse information‚Äù will be one to three years in prison. If the court finds that a person spread false information as part of an organization that is illegal, the sentence will be doubled.

Journalists might also be arrested under the new law for hiding sources who gave them ‚Äúfalse information.‚Äù

Under the new law, web-only media outlets will be allowed to register as periodical media publications. While that makes them enjoy some of the privileges of traditional media, like press cards, they will be required to follow some rules. For instance, they will be required to remove content the government deems false and must archive their publications, which allows the government to more easily block access to their websites.

‚ÄúOn the request of the ministries, the President may decide to remove the content and/or block access to be fulfilled within four hours regarding broadcasts on the internet,‚Äù the new law states, referring to the President of the Information and Communication Technologies Authority.

The law also updated the regulations on official press cards. The old regulations, which were created by the Communications Directorate, which answers to the president, gave the government the authority to cancel press cards of journalists who criticized the government.

The new law will create a Press Card Commission, which will have nine members, five from the Communications Directorate and the others will be representatives from journalists‚Äô unions and academics.

The draft bill was severely condemned by journalists. In a joint statement, the Turkish Committee of the International Press Institute, the Journalists‚Äô Association, and the Journalists‚Äô Union of Turkey said that they were ‚Äúconcerned that it may lead to one of the most severe censorship and self-censorship mechanisms in the history of the republic, we call for the immediate withdrawal of this bill, which seems to have been designed to increase the pressure on journalism, not ‚Äòfight against disinformation.‚Äù

An old man in hospital had received no nursing care for a week. He wasn‚Äôt fed for three days. He asked a nurse if he could be bathed. She brought him a damp paper towel and told him to do it himself.

A 92-year-old former ward sister was told that she had terminal liver failure. The doctor had apparently conducted an examination via a video link. A face to face visit was refused. Taken by a relative to the local A&E department, the woman was diagnosed with a simple infection ‚Äì treated with antibiotics. Three days later she made a full recovery. (There had been a 12 hour wait on a ward trolley.)

A patient was admitted to hospital as an emergency had to wait 49 hours before a bed could be found for him.

A patient with a broken arm, in great pain, was told by an ambulance service that her condition wasn‚Äôt life-threatening and that the wait would be eight hours.

An 89-year-old woman waited six hours for an ambulance and died.

It is now recognised that failing ambulance services are responsible for many deaths. In Northern Ireland ambulance delays were a contributory factor in 14 deaths. Ambulances spend 25% to 30% of their time waiting outside emergency departments.

An NHS boss who had a stroke was taken to hospital by her husband and recovered. She said it might have been different if she‚Äôd called 999.

Waiting times for ambulances have never been as long. The ambulance service is so bad that patients are told to call a taxi ‚Äì it‚Äôll be quicker.

Such stories now abound.

Hospitals are so badly run that millions of people would rather stay at home ‚Äì even if that means dying alone and without medical care. Hospital staff have taken away dignity and hope ‚Äì even these are among the most valuable things a doctor or nurse can offer. They have replaced hope and dignity with despair and disillusionment.

Seriously ill patients who visit Accident and Emergency units in hospitals must routinely wait ten hours for treatment. It is reported that 90% of patients who visit A&E go there because they cannot contact their GP. That‚Äôs not surprising. The average GP now works a three-day week or less. Most made a fortune giving Covid jabs and are trying to keep their tax bills down. Even those who work a full week manage less hours than a librarian ‚Äì and never see emergencies. Many GPs stay at home and still refuse to see patients face to face. The evidence proves this is dangerous, but it is, say doctors, the future. GPs claim they are overworked, but the evidence proves the contrary.

Physiotherapy departments which shut in March 2020 are still shut. Physiotherapists work from home though no one explains how they manage this.

While patients are ignored, the NHS spends a fortune on hiring ‚Äòequality, diversity and inclusion‚Äô administrators ‚Äì though no one knows what these people are supposed to do or why they are considered necessary. Hospitals pay huge salaries to employees with jobs as bizarre as ‚ÄòHard FM Commissioning Manager‚Äô and ‚ÄòPortfolio Lead for People-Led Care‚Äô ‚Äì though no one seems to know what these titles mean. There‚Äôs a shortage of nurses and beds but ‚ÄòEquality chiefs‚Äô are paid ¬£90,387 a year and there are ‚Äòdiversity managers‚Äô galore.

People who collapse at home or in the street are routinely tested for Covid ‚Äì even though the test that is used has been proved to be entirely useless. If they test positive they are put on a Covid ward and forgotten. They receive no other tests and no treatment. This isn‚Äôt medicine ‚Äì it is cultism.

Patients who complain are simply drugged and sent to sleep. There appears to be war on the elderly ‚Äì with hospitals slapping Do Not Resuscitate notices on just about everyone over 60 (and a good many younger than that).

Everyone who falls ill is regarded by the NHS as a burden ‚Äì a second class citizen. Everyone ill over 60 is a 3rd class citizen ‚Äì not worth bothering with.

MPs have warned that there is no evidence that Britain‚Äôs appalling cancer care will catch up with other countries. Another 2.7 million have joined the cancer backlog waiting diagnosis and care. The number is increasing by 1,000 a day.

The driving forces of modern medicine are stupidity, greed, incompetence and ignorance. Doctors and nurses seem too busy or too uppity to do what they‚Äôre paid to do.

Doctors and hospitals who have been told to abandon crazy Covid rules (masks, hand sanitiser and social distancing) are, like children holding onto comfort blankets, insisting on clinging to these insanities. It‚Äôs been proven that masks, sanitiser and social distancing did far more harm than good. But no one in health care understands science anymore.

Last year absurd new working rules meant that 2,000 dentists quit the NHS. Over four million patients now have no access to NHS dental care. Those who can find an NHS dentist are waiting three years for an appointment.

Hospitals have been told that it is illegal to prevent relatives or friends accompanying or visiting patients. But hospital staff break the law without caring.

Waiting lists are now so long that most patients will die before they are treated. Private health care services cannot cope with the sudden rise in demand. A third of 18-34 year olds are considering funding their own private care and 85% of patients on NHS waiting lists have paid for or are considering private treatment. Consultants are making a fortune.

The NHS has more money than it needs. But most of the money is wasted on administrators. There are more of those than there are beds or nurses!

If the NHS were closed down and the money shared out, every one in Britain would be able to afford excellent private medical care.

The NHS is dead. Let‚Äôs bury it.
